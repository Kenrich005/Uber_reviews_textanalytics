0,Dishonest and Disgusting,1,"For half an hour, we tried EVERY UBER SERVICE to take a short trip. Uber FALSELY advertised drop-offs by certain times but DID NOT DELIVER ONCE. Finally, we downloded Lyft and immediately got a car that was two minutes away.",29-12-2020 01:14
1,Free offer,2,If I’m not eligible for the offer Stop flooding my email with this false information pouting face pouting face pouting face ,01-01-2021 23:17
2,Inaccurate,2,Consistently inaccurate Uber Eats ETA and the food menus often have errors.,15-01-2021 23:38
3,sea,1,i had my rides canceled back to back. they then still charged my account for a cancellation fee. i tried to get my money back but they only gave me money on the app but i want my money back on my card. i also wasn’t able to get in touch with any help from uber. terrible,08-12-2020 01:01
4,Double charged me for an order,1,"Two of the same orders was added by accident. The restaurant tried to remove the order but couldn't. We both tried reaching uber eats and the restaurant ended up not charging me for the order and told me to put in a claim with uber (which i did).

Months later, Uber charges me and their customer service was very short and didn’t look into the issue as in depth as they should.  I’ve been using Uber for years and this is the last straw.

Will be supporting BAM instead. Another customer lost.",15-12-2020 04:02
5,Not the best,2,Why even offer promotions when no one really wants to pick you up at a very cheap price and end up paying the same or more for a ride that is about 6 minutes away.,05-01-2021 16:55
6,Hate this app,1,I hate this app it canceled my ride and ain’t even give me my money back yall scammers,11-12-2020 22:31
7,In between,3,It’s very good at times but I find that the drivers have gps but always miss turns on pick ups and drops offs so that’s annoying,24-12-2020 21:01
8,No customer support number. Deleting this app now.,1,No customer support. I can’t just call to a representative. This is a horrible service. Will never use or recommend to anyone.,26-12-2020 23:08
9,Terrible,1,Makes it too difficult to make an account. Seemingly impossible to link type of information to any other number or email address. Terrible,21-12-2020 01:48
10,Ridiculous,1,"I hate this app and company. But unfortunately it’s only slightly better than Lyft, so I still use it when in a pinch. I was reported by a driver that I “wasn’t wearing a mask.” Which was false. I work in an IMU with COVID patients. The last thing I would do is risk someone’s safety. Now, I have to submit a picture of myself wearing a mask to get a ride. Ridiculous.",01-01-2021 04:13
11,Trash,1,No matter what the app does what it wants to do and does NOT cooperate. 0/10,11-12-2020 17:50
12,Cant change pick up location,2,"Stupid app wont make me change pick up location , really cant see this on my app, if its possible then make it visible PLEASE!",26-12-2020 23:15
13,Going to Lyft after this,1,"Literally 2 canceled rides back to back never dealt with such unprofessionalism in a long time. I actually laughed till I cried as I watched not 1 BUT 2 of my drivers drive AWAY from my location and claimed to be lost, Never again",06-12-2020 05:47
14,About Pet,3,Half the time that drivers accept a ride with Uber pet they refuse when they pick me and the furry friend up. Seems that they aren’t being notified that pets are joining the ride. Please look into this and see if you can notify the driver so they don’t accept rides with pets if they don’t want them inside their vehicles.,19-12-2020 03:06
15,Terrible Customer Service,1,"Really hard to find a phone number to talk to someone when something goes wrong and then the phone number dose not even work, says they can’t support phone support at this time. Didn’t apply a promo code correctly and then charged me an additional $5 and can’t get it corrected.  FYI 1-866-268-6964",01-12-2020 18:17
16,Offering 3x 4x & 5x prices. WhAAAT?,1,Offering an original rate like $10-$12 but then offers rides for $20-$30-$40 while you wait to get confirmation for original rate. In 5-7 minutes the app just cancel ls the entire ride. Ordered lyft with no problems.,22-11-2020 23:18
17,Cancellations,2,"Uber has really been irritating me lately. I used Uber to get to work and other destinations of course. But I’ll order an Uber at a perfect time, to where I’m not late for work, but when I go to order the Uber the closest car would be about 10 mins away from me (which is perfect btw) but for some reason, I kept getting cars that were OVER 20 mins away (making me late for work). I just had this problem, I would cancel and cancel until I got a closer car, BUT THE SAME PERSON THAT WAS SUPER FAR KEPT ACCEPTING ME. I cancelled like 7 times (taking up my time) and I still couldn’t get away from that person. That is dangerous and Uber needs to change that. If you cancel on a person ATLEAST twice, then that car shouldn’t be an option for you anymore. I had to personally text that person to stop accepting me because they are too far. But once they stopped accepting me, well I got another Uber that was still over 20 mins away and I had to settle because all the cancelling was just wasting my time. Uber you should make it a priority for people to get the cars closer to them, and if there are none, then make the further cars available.",02-01-2021 23:09
18,Check this out’,1,Amazing app! But the fact that Uber drivers keep canceling my trip and making my trip a little longer isn’t a great way to start off the morning! Please and review with your drivers to not cancel the trips! And make sure not to go to the wrong direction! Thank you!,27-12-2020 11:31
19,False accusations of no masks,1,"I got a recent email threatening me with account deactivation for not wearing a mask in a recent Uber. This is false - I have worn masks in all my Uber rides since the pandemic began and there is no way to contest this charge. 

I appreciate ubers mask policy. I would not ride Uber if masks were not required. But users should
not be punished for drivers incorrect reports.",04-01-2021 03:11
20,0 Support,1,"If you’re thinking about downloading Uber or Lyft, do not pick Uber. They offer little to no support and it is impossible to get in contact with anyone. Their support email doesn’t work, even though their contact phone number specifically directs you to send and email and hangs up. They make it all to easy to sign up for Uber Pass accidentally just to hit you with $149 charge. I saw the 149 on my credit card statement after ordering an Uber in the middle of the day. Took me forever to figure out what happened. It also signs you up for automatic renewal of that subscription...I’ve been trying to contact them to dispute the charge but it has been a nightmare. Their blog say “24/7 phone support” ummmmm, where???",19-12-2020 21:21
21,Wait fee,1,"The Uber app showed like the guy was down the road yet and he was just waiting at the driveway then I got charged about a full dollar when I thought he wasn’t there yet,,, and I also don’t believe in the stupid mask policy,,,!",28-12-2020 10:34
22,Above,1,This app is so horrible,26-12-2020 12:08
23,Super stupid,2,Uber says no cars available.,19-01-2021 16:38
24,takes me and my drunk friends home very nicely,5,"whenever my friends and i go out we need rides home because we are very very lit by the end of the night, wether we are going home with with a random guy from the bar or going home crying in my best friends arms, uber always works and is very nice to have. love all my drivers xoxo",28-12-2020 00:17
25,Uber support,1,"I upgraded to an iPhone 12. Downloaded Uber app. Logged in. My family profile is not accessible. Ubers help is clear the day to settings / profiles and select family. I do not have a family option. I had to contact Uber through Twitter, who then told me my app version must be old when it was down loaded this morning. Very disappointed",19-12-2020 20:13
26,Playing with your time energy and money,1,"So I have been an Uber driver for years and have lost a lot of money due to financial misconduct performed by Ubers business with its contractors. I have also ordered Uber eats and ubers and have had double charges they mask as holds messing with our bank accounts. Some are actually going through as a double charge and then, them having to go and refund after it’s caught Causing us to miss out on or wait on our own money that’s not theirs to play with. If it’s not caught they gain more money off of us. I’ve had items missing and it’s not fair to have to wait 3-5 or even 1-3 business days for our money back or a correction when you didn’t have to wait all those days for our payment for the food or ride. Your system is not for the people. Just because your service is created for convenience it ends up being more of a burden when you all pick and choose when you want to be professional. Your a company servicing the ppl not your own individual entity servicing yourself. That’s what you do at home in your personal life. But if I create a company, It’s business and customers come first, not seeing how you can take their money by mentally tricking them through technology apps or various changes in your policies. Your 3rd party partnerships should be more in tact to where your all aware of the other and not one can mess with us consumers and displace blame on another causing us issues with our money. I am not your dog pig or test dummy. Your targeting needs to cease, It’s petty childish and really immature. There’s more to life you have the power to make it better but you all are abusing it.",23-12-2020 15:29
27,Come on,1,I swear it’s the worst when it’s come to Uber eat,15-12-2020 18:06
28,LAGS AND OVER CHARGES FOR NOTHING,1,"I currently have an issue regarding an over charge as the normal amount would be between $16-$19 from my home to work, yet I was over charged nearly $50 for only one ride/trip. Then charged me again the following morning when I haven’t even used it. I already spend nearly over $100 every week for rides and this has never happened to me before. I've been trying to find customer service on the app and online to no avail. If I can’t get this problem solved I’m going to have to get a claim done.",20-11-2020 20:24
29,Service,5,"I live in North Dakota, I need to buy stuff from people in Miami , and deliver those stuff in another address in Miami, the question will be, do you offer that kind of service? If so, could you please let me know how?",14-12-2020 16:09
30,Stop your push notifications your stupid promos pouting face ,1,"I don’t want to order food on you app, I don’t wanna order groceries on your app.  JUST STOP. 

Sick and tired of having on my home screen for no good reason.",14-01-2021 22:55
31,Uber has had a HUGE DECLINE,1,Uber used to be good in LA. Now it keeps asking us to confirm a higher price ride then cancels if we don’t accept it. Waste of time and money. Lyft all the way now!,27-11-2020 12:11
32,Transportation,3,"I rely on Uberas transportation to work. As good as they are, they have double charged, cancelled my ride as I wait for them. Many of the drivers do not know how to follow the GPS nor do they understand English",19-12-2020 15:46
33,Horrible Customer Service,1,I have requested to speak to customer service for several days now and I have not heard anything back from them nor is there any messages on the Uber app or Uber website. I canceled a ride within 2 1/2 minutes after requesting the ride. The driver did not get out of the city that they were in let alone make it to my city. From what I could see on the Uber app the driver did not drive more than 2 miles.I didn’t even see them pass a red light on a road that has an excessive amount of red lights. I was only supposed to be charge $16.76 for the trip but since I canceled the ride Uber canceled the $16.76 charge and instead I was charged an even $17!,17-01-2021 23:46
34,TECH ERROR POSED RISK,1,"Upon creating an account, I attempted to add a payment method; which failed consistently/was unable to process despite any card, bank account, or device used. I was STRANDED as I could not pay for a ride despite having money readily available- it continuously said unable to process.  I was forced to call for help from a friend who ordered one for me on their account. HOWEVER- when even attempting to reach customer service/Uber Help once I reached my safe location, no one answered (or has yet to answer) through the help service, the email, or the customer service Uber hotline AT ALL. Uber is dangerous and I made it clear (to the customer service agent that never answered in Uber Help) that I was taking my service to Lyft. If you are nervous about using Uber; save yourself time and go elsewhere without putting yourself at risk (especially if you need a ride when intoxicated). Additionally, I wanted to mention that I am a 20 year old woman (a fact that poses initial risk within itself).",17-12-2020 20:33
35,Not safe,1,Almost got kidnapped,09-12-2020 21:25
36,annoying,1,"so when you first download uber you can’t even log into an existing account, you have to create one.. as soon as it realizes the information you’re typing in is already linked with an account, it says “account already exists” and doesn’t let you click anything that says “log into existing account”. so i’m trying to figure out another way to login maybe seeing what it does when i use my facebook to log in instead.. nope it just says “you’ve opted out of receiving SMS notifications, to re-opt, text *specific word* to *specific number*”. and that’s exactly what i do. then i go back to the app and NOTHING happens, so i retry using my facebook now that i’ve enabled SMS.. and it says “sorry, too many requests” GIRL WHAT! i guess now i can’t use uber.",31-12-2020 14:32
37,above,3,i like uber i really do but lyft has better prices confused face ,19-01-2021 21:33
38,Someone will be dead before you get an Uber.,1,"Your policy is getting worse and worse! I’m so tired of it! Yesterday I ordered uber, waited 10min and the  driver just drove by without stopping and canceled the trip. I was supposed go see my friend who got into a huge car accident and now he is fighting for his life. I had to wait more time for another car and crying because I thought I’ll never see my friend again. Someone will really be dead sometimes before you get an Uber if your drivers will keep canceling rides upon your policy. 
Oh you know what? They gave me $7 for this issue. Wow. Thanks. 
From now on, I’m gonna rate every driver with one star until you change your policy. I don’t have a car and guess what? I use Uber 4-6 times almost every day. Let’s count it........
To be continued......",04-12-2020 17:59
39,Can’t login,1,Ever since they’ve done all these updates I cant even log in to my account. Customer service is a joke. I email back to back and get no response. The dumbest thing is that they took off the password option so now I have no way of accessing my account anymore since I changed my phone number. Not to mention that every time I put in my new number it never sends me the text with the code,07-01-2021 06:45
40,Uber is trash,1,"I’ve always had bad experiences, too much money and they always send me drivers that are 27 min away ? Like what’s the point if I have to wait half an hour for a driver. Uber is a joke try another app.",01-01-2021 04:25
41,Eats is racist,1,"If you like to avoid supporting racists, you should avoid this app. The UberEats integration has the race of the owner listed by some restaurants.",22-12-2020 18:54
42,Awesome app but bad technical support,3,"While the application is really awesome and helpful the developer’s team has to to do a better job in supporting the customers when there is a bug in the app. I have been messaging the Uber team for few weeks now informing them that there is a problem with the family profiles on iPhones and all what I get from them: we are working on it!! Last week I sent another message and the support team sent me the instructions on how to use the family profile!! When I sent them the previous conversations, they replied back that they have a problem!! You have just released a new update but no fix.",12-01-2021 04:50
43,Find a different service,1,"I can tell the customer isn’t the priority here. I won’t be using Uber eats or Uber again. Refund in the form of Uber cash - you got to be kidding. This is the second or third consecutive time my order has been past the “latest arrival time”. Had you all been able to refund my order, you would’ve retained a repeat business customer, and earned more than the worth of the refund over time. Uber, you’re not the only food service in town. Start treating people who use your services better.",19-01-2021 15:05
44,Not what it used to be.,1,"Scheduled a ride ahead of time for work, didn’t find out until less than 5 minutes of departure that there were no drivers in the area. Used to never have a problem getting a ride anywhere anytime, even if it cost more.",23-12-2020 21:23
45,Uber eats,1,I used uber eats and they robbed me 4 times I never received my money back and I never got the food.0/5 I do not recommend.,14-01-2021 00:27
46,Stop Trying To Trick Riders,1,"Uber has a new feature where, while you’re outside the app, you will get a notification saying “Your ride is now at a higher price. Open the app to accept,” and when you open the app they try to get you to agree to upgrade to an uber comfort or uber black. It’s a completely underhanded tactic.",28-12-2020 05:07
47,Pedro,1,This app is a waste of money use Lyft instead,01-01-2021 09:56
48,Consider Lyft,1,I don’t know why I use it when Lyft has more drivers. I have to wait 15 minutes for a driver every morning I’m in a rush.,21-12-2020 11:39
49,Pickup issues,1,This app has glitches and told my drivers to pick me up at addresses miles away,02-01-2021 11:57
50,Issue logging in,2,It does not provide a place for me to login my old account. Instead is keeps asking me to input my phone number and send me codes. But the codes aren’t correct can’t be recognized in app. Bad design.,23-12-2020 03:23
51,Not Satisfied to what it is becoming,1,"Uber is such a good app, however, it has saddened me to see that we have to pay an extra $4 to just bring our dog with us. Not even regular taxis are like that. It is crazy to see that Uber has changed a lot but for the worst, especially during this time. I have to pay $25 to just go to work when it’s usually 10-12 dollars. The reason to that is because of the weather which I feel like they shouldn’t even do that. Uber is literally full of scams and I’m upset that I’m realizing this now. I don’t even understand why are you adding an extra $4 to just bring our dog. And on top of that, we have to pay more due to the weather. I strongly don’t agree with the changes you guys have made. Literally, y’all don’t have sympathy to what has been going on in this world and the fact that you are increasing the price makes it even harder to live. It’s not fair, especially for a student who is still pay for his tuition..",18-12-2020 22:30
52,Overcharged & not reimbursed.,1,"I have used uber for years and am aware of surcharges. I wasn’t given any warning they’d charge me double, then they refunded 1/4th of the trip. Stealing your customers money isn’t a good look.",14-12-2020 15:27
53,Wait times,2,"Dude.. what is up with the wait times? I’m in Tulsa. It used to be so quick and easy to get an Uber. Now it takes 15-20 for a driver to get here when most drivers were usually 3-5 mins away.
I’ve heard you guys cut the drivers pay for the prime time hours or something? So now you’re scaring off the drivers? The lack of drivers is insane, I’ve never had a hard time getting an Uber before this.",10-01-2021 21:12
54,Unavailable,3,"Kinda left me stranded saying they can’t kind a car for me for over an hour , had to download lyft",12-01-2021 22:32
55,Most expensive ride sharing app,1,"I’ve been a reliable customer of Ubers since 2017. Lately, I can’t get a ride anywhere (I’m in LA). They say a ride is around the corner, but they’ll have to charge me 4x what the original price is if I want to accept it.... not cool. Lyft doesn’t do the same thing. Uber is only for the wealthy now, yeeesh",22-12-2020 20:48
56,Took my money,1,I ordered groceries and they took my money and never processed the order,28-12-2020 22:16
57,The worst customer service!!!!!!,1,See my review in Uber eats. I will not be using their ride sharing service either. F’ this company,07-12-2020 17:23
58,Worse Customer Support Ever,1,"These people are the worse. They make you wait 10 minutes for a ride, that is going further from you, then charge you a fee. The app never works when you need help with something. It feels like a scam. Idk how this got 4.7 stars. I’m glad other people have a good experience with this bs",18-11-2020 19:54

60,Worthless garbage,1,I’ve been burned by this app from the driving services to the food delivery that just doesn’t care enough to actually find your house but still marks your order as delivered anyways and so you got to go through the whole refund debacle and they don’t have a call center right now... of any kind? Garbage in comparison to Lyft and other resources such as Door Dash and Grub Hub,05-12-2020 02:01
61,"Uber is criminal componey, this componey abused driver, Uber is be gready get 90 % driver money.",1,Do not use Uber technology,15-12-2020 06:17
62,Uber pass,1,"Be careful!!! Uber will charge your card for a monthly subscription of $24.99, never notify you, and refuse to issue a refund when you discover you’ve been charged for this on a monthly basis! If 0 stars was an option that’s what they’d be getting. I’ll ride LYFT from now on",12-12-2020 12:51
63,Share uber locayion,1,I give them one star because what if a parent wants to send their son or daughter at the age of  17 in the  uber  their kid in the uber and the parents dont know if he or she is safe to their destination they are supposed to go while in uber  to thats why i give them one star because the share button is supposed to work in case of emergency,25-12-2020 23:33
64,A22Hole is operated ever.,1,I had more than 20 rides on uber and sexually harassed many times by female and male drivers. That sounds ridiculous. And some drivers was smelling alcohol.,21-11-2020 19:56
65,Issue after issue.,1,"The mapping of current location is wrong lots of times and when corrected manually it never sticks. Downloaded Lyft and it’s much better.  You can actually manually put where you are standing so that the driver comes to you.  Now trying to get my canx fees refunded back to me, because the drivers canx after waiting 1 min in a wrong location, has been a task.",01-01-2021 17:04
66,Unreliable,2,Extremely unreliable. They’ll say they have cars available and get you to book and then suddenly there’s none available when they charge your card. Still waiting on my charge to come back. Absolutely ridiculous,24-11-2020 18:40
67,It’s never going to be perfect,2,"Every ride has a 15-20 minute wait now, whether I’m only trying to take a ride down the street a few blocks or fifteen minutes away. It’s ridiculous. Drivers sit and don’t move and also don’t cancel so YOU have to cancel after waiting for them to even move towards your direction, and end up getting charged a fee. Now uber has also made it a pain to dispute a charge, and tries to prompt you to sign in through the desktop page and not just give you the options to choose what your issue was through the app. 
Annoying.",20-01-2021 07:59
68,Unreasonable,1,"Had a >4.7 rating and I got kicked off for basically no reason. Their customer service people don’t listen to you, they look at you like a number. Disgusting company with no sense of responsibility.",09-01-2021 02:49

70,Service Slipping,3,"I used to love Uber, now it’s never simple. It takes 3+ mins to even connect me to a driver every time and when I do finally get a driver EVERY time there is a significant price increase. I was riding from Long Beach to LAX and the price went from $30 to $90 when they connected me.",15-12-2020 12:21
71,"Never worth it, especially in NY",1,"Not easy, not inexpensive. If you get held up in traffic they will charge you for the pleasure. If you get dropped by multiple driver because of your destination they will do nothing to help you. This use to be a good service, but if you are ordering a car in New York, save yourself the time, money and frustration. Never again.",22-12-2020 23:22
72,Uber is a parasitic business,1,"Last month California voters passed Prop 22, safeguarding the right of gig economy companies to misclassify their workers as contractors and pay them sub-minimum wages, withhold benefits, evade payroll and unemployment taxes, etc.

Uber/Lyft spent $200m to secure that win.

As Prop 22's promoters remind us: Gig work is the new unemployment benefit: it's a private-sector jobs guarantee, work you can get at the tap of your screen. It's a perfect labor market – workers effectively bid to offer the best price to perform servant work for others.

The more workers there are, and the more desperate their situation is, the lower the payments go. A lot of those savings are siphoned off by the (money-losing, stock-soaring) gig companies, but some of it is passed onto customers.

This is by design.",21-11-2020 01:19

76,Charged me for Uber pass,1,"I’ve liked Uber for years and never had a problem until they started charging me and my other family members for “Uber pass”. I have never purchased this pass, neither has anyone in my family, but it seems I have been charged for an Uber pass. This also happened to my mother and was hard to resolve. So if anyone downloads Uber I recommend checking your bank account regularly to make sure they don’t charge you, apparently this is common.",18-01-2021 09:07
77,Worst drivers,4,"I still left a 4 star cause it’s obviously not Uber’s fault, the drivers here just seem to be some of the worst, and have no patience, driver didn’t even wait, just left",24-12-2020 20:47

81,Getting over your skis uber,1,Getting way too complicated - easy to use was a cornerstone now it’s broken,10-12-2020 23:35
82,Horrible customer service,1,"I ordered a scheduled ride today for 5pm when I got off work. I had to lock the front door and walk around the building. It took me approximately 1.5 minutes to do so and as I was walking up behind the vehicle (LEHU32, “Ris”) drove away before 2 minutes had even passed. I got charged $5 for the ride and now I have no way home. I tried to wave the car down but he kept driving, ignoring my attempts. I am done with this company. He got his money and I have nothing to show for it. Somehow this driver has 4.9 stars, how? I am so infuriated by this process, I won’t be ordering anymore Ubers in the future.",05-01-2021 22:22
83,Far ubers,1,For whatever reason every morning uber keeps sending me ubers that are   Almost 20 minutes away do not use this app use lyft at-least they will send a ride that a reasonable amount of time away,12-01-2021 13:27
84,App Confusing,1,Horrible to use. Can’t even find ride types anywhere. Bad way to enter trip location,25-12-2020 15:22
85,Doing Too Much.,1,Why do they accept rides if they’re 25 minutes + away? People have things to do and places to go and drivers shouldn’t really be allowed to accept the ride if they’re still finishing one. Or at least inform us that they’re in the middle of finishing so WE can choose if we want to wait or not. Completely unnecessary smh.,09-01-2021 12:02
86,Ridiculous waiting times in Puerto Vallarta,1,"Only ride with Uber in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, if you’re willing to wait for your ride for 15 minutes or risk your ride being cancelled after waiting for 10 minutes and then have the cancelation blamed and sometimes charged on you.
Worst service in Mexico I’ve have ever experienced... not even their Informal competitor (inDriver) is this unprofessional. 
Be prepared for spam on your phone with fake offers, promising up to 25% off... 
I now only use Uber when I’m truly offered a discount, have time to spare and as a last resort.
All of the above is what I have found after riding in Puerto Vallarta with Uber for a year... Now I prefer using their cheaper competitor. Why pay more for Uber and their inferior service?
Be well informed of your options when traveling to Puerto Vallarta in Mexico.",22-11-2020 05:32

90,There is no way to talk to an actual human when you need help.,1,"I ordered from Uber eats of the Uber app. After getting my order several days later I went into my bank account and noticed that Uber charged me twice on two separate days for the same amount. My order was placed on December 31, the first transaction was on January 2, and the second transaction was on January 4. When trying to contact Uber to get my refund of at least one of the transactions. My help options were very limited in fact I couldn’t even find anywhere where it says contact us. I’ve never had any trouble with Uber or Uber eats before I don’t know what happened with this transaction. But the customer service is absolutely ridiculous. I still have not received a refund for one of the transactions that hit my bank account.",06-01-2021 19:41
91,Sad,1,"I tried for two hours to find an Uber and only two popped up and either of them took the ride they just waited for my request to time out there needs to be a penalty for this so they don’t do it anymore

92,Horrible.,1,"I have had Uber downloaded for a while now and every single time I’ve needed a ride the app stalls out and I have to try requesting a ride several times before having to delete the app and redownload it. I always start requesting my rides 45mins before I have to be somewhere and every single time I have been late to work though my place of work is not even a 5 minute drive from my house, standing outside for 30 minutes because my ride that was 22 mins away 40mins ago is now 35mins away and has sent me a text saying “sry. Trafic” it took my driver an hour and 15 minutes to reach me for a 6 minute trip before. Will be switching to Lyft.",05-01-2021 14:21
93,App glitch horrible customer service response time,1,I just bought $70 Uber cash all for it to tell me I can’t request a ride then I though that if I added a card on file that the problem would be resolved nope the app wouldn’t even allow me to add my debit card I’ve contacted Uber customer service through the app it’s been 24hrs without a response also let me add that they don’t even have a 1800 number so for an example you’re getting robbed by your driver or need to talk to a rep Immediately who are you going to call? Idk you’ll be better off calling ghost busters,19-12-2020 00:43
94,Terrible customer service,1,"I spend almost $10k/year with Uber. Literally take it everywhere. When I have an issue it can’t even be addressed because these agents on computer give the same generic answers, word for word. I have now explained my issue at least 20 times for me to be told I’m getting priority support, they then give me another generic response and end the case. NEVER ONCE ADDRESSING MY ACTUAL ISSUE. just go use Lyft at least they don’t try to charge you 3x the price",17-12-2020 19:00
95,Unsure about Uber,2,"I amen unable to drive due today fractured leg.
Called Uber to take me to a Doctor’s office for an appointment.
It was a to-way trip with Uber but with different drivers.
The first driver charged me less than the second driver by $4.00.
I don’t understand that since it was the EXACT same distance.
I can’t seem to get an answer from Uber.  But it really “ticked” me off!",11-12-2020 17:38
96,Awful Service,1,"Uber works beautifully but when you have a problem, absolutely forget about getting help. There is no humanly way to get ahold of a person. You get the pleasure of going through loop after loop with no help in sight. SO FRUSTRATING!!!!!",02-01-2021 16:29
97,I would definitely give 5 stars but.....,1,"I would give five stars no problem but there’s this thing with this app that after 12:00 at night it’s very hard to find a ride to short distances, then they try to change your ride total to a outrageous price a 8$ ride will go up to 21$ I think that’s absolutely insane honestly",10-01-2021 10:17
98,It's okay,2,It’s nice when you need a “quick” ride but lately the app has just been so bad. It crashes constantly and I keep getting drives that are so far out they call to ask me to cancel and then I’m late. I usually order my Uber’s 30 minutes before I need to be somewhere just so I’m not late and even then I’m late.,24-11-2020 20:52
99,Disgraceful Business,1,"I used Uber once over a year ago on a business trip. And about 2 months ago I found out they'd enrolled me in a reoccurring subscription 5 months after my trip, and charged my account 24.99 for months WITHOUT my consent. Never signed up for that at all because I never use the service. It is literally impossible to get ahold of any form of customer service, which I assume is by design. However after days of trying to figure it out I got ahold of them through Facebook (pathetic, right?). After trying to fight the charges and get a refund, they told me all they could do was cancel the service and give me a $30 voucher for their food service. Which I've never used and of course don't want to use. Do yourself a huge favor and use Lyft. Uber is a disgrace and I've read many others have had this same issue. They should be sued in a class-action lawsuit for this type of practice.",10-01-2021 01:09
100,Not good if you are legally blind,1,I have had several issues with Uber because of my eye sight.  This app is very difficult to see and impossible to find the new Uber pet feature.  I have had drivers cancel on me because I could not find their car.  My final straw was today when I tried taking my dog to the groomer but the driver would not take me and instead of canceling they just kept sending me more drivers until I would pay $5 to cancel.  I feel discriminated against and no one cares.  I am done with Uber.,05-12-2020 16:54
101,"Worst Service on Market, Pyramid Scheme",1,"Terrible wait times

They let drivers bid on riders and search for the highest paid rides leaving you standing for up to 30 minutes at a time watching drivers decline offers left and right 

The app will try to offer you ride up to 80% more expensive the original offer. 

Drivers have terrible attitudes and jaded Opinions and wield too much power with what rides they can decline. Leaving customers stranded.

I have lived with plenty of these drivers. Wether they are a husband or wife or 20 something. They do nothing but sit around their houses, this is an easy Job. Do not let the political campaigns and the bout between the drivers and the company fool you. These are glorified taxi drivers working for a multi million dollar company headed by snakes. 

Do not trust them with your information. And do not waste your time relying on their service.",25-12-2020 04:15
102,Don’t remember thier names-concussion,5,Very nice and respectful and helped me to figure out how to get there. Sounds simple but when you have a concussion it’s very hard to remember where you’re going and each driver was so kind!,08-12-2020 11:18
103,Fraudulent Chargers,1,I was chartered over $100 over a two day time period for rides I never took. My bank reversed the chargers thankfully but I was forced to change my card number because Uber kept adding more charges.,21-12-2020 21:27

106,Over charged or falls charge,1,"Simply put any charges  which we hv never used 
Worst customer service",19-11-2020 16:16
107,These people are not Americans.,1,Uber sent me an email about how they want drivers to snitch on passengers and passengers to snitch on drivers like we are in some kind of World War II German government about having panties on your face. We don’t do that kind of crap here in America. Uber you are fired I am now using other companies that are 100% American. My network of pilots use to use Uber several times a day they are now losing lots of money because they sent threat emails to my company pilots.,20-12-2020 23:25
108,Rides are way to expensive,1,"My Uber driver was sick while driving, he kept coughing during the COVID-19 Pandemic",22-12-2020 09:08
109,Drivers are cheapskates !!,1,"This is the first time I have got out of my way to write a review because it’s so unbelievable that not even this pandemic are prices OR PEOPLE more reasonable. The worst thing is that I have been late to my job so many times because none of the drivers will take me . It’s always because they want to charge me 30-40$ to take me somewhere that is literally 10 minutes away ?? And if not , the driver is 15-20 minutes away from me. Sometimes if I’m unlucky enough , the Uber cancels after I’ve been waiting forever to arrive . Please find a way to terminate their greedy issue. Some of us can’t afford expensive Uber’s during this pandemic and don’t have nearby transportation methods",28-12-2020 16:06
110,Disappointed,2,"Uber is a good app for rides, but sometimes the prices be way to high. I work 10 mins away and it’s $25 every morning now, usually it’s $8 - $10.. so i started using lyft :)",05-01-2021 16:57
111,Depletes battery too quickly on iPhone 12 Pro,3,This app depletes my battery faster than my phone can charge. Whether it’s plugged in or not. This is the only app that does this.,21-01-2021 01:51
112,Fraudulent charges,1,Obviously you’ve been hacked on New Years Eve 2020... and you refuse to deal with fraudulent charges made to my now canceled debit card. I will not be giving you business in the future. Zero stars if I could.,04-01-2021 17:47

114,Give honest and accurate prices,1,"I live in LA. Your new system of telling customers there price will be between two amounts and then your drivers offering an amount this is ALWAYS above your own estimation, is absolute garbage. It’s dishonest of you to tell people prices that aren’t real. Either get rid of the feature or tell your drivers to be more realistic. You’re wasting everyone’s time.",11-01-2021 23:31

117,no help,1,Yesterday I applied $120.00 to a uber gift card at family dollar .I missed work due to not being able to get trip . Pls help,25-11-2020 18:41
118,Racist Driver,1,"Before I start this review I would like to say that I find it very idiotic that as big of a corporation that Uber is,that they do not provide an actual customer service or corporate number for a customer to speak to a representative over the phone,but you have to go through an app instead of actually having someone hear your concerns out… Last Thursday 12/31/2020 I had an extremely rude and racist Uber driver Verbally cuss me and my employee out,referring to us as “GoodWill brand Ni***rs” all because he couldn’t communicate outside of a preschool grade level. So instead of being able to speak to a representative and file a complaint on their associate’s behavior,I’m met with a bunch of runaround contacts...Anyways I can only identify the driver through his FL License plate #764TXL in a silver Mercedes-Benz C class sedan I do hope the driver learns that when working for a business you are expected to act accordingly and all actions do have consequences...I do apologize that it took me resorting to the actual app to file a complaint then to actually be met with a customer representative if only Uber had one.",04-01-2021 13:57

120,Trash,1,Terrible app wish I could give it no stars Lyft is better,24-11-2020 22:10
121,DO NOT GET,1,I used the app to get home but it was taking like 20 mins to find a driver so I didn’t even have a ride no one was on their way to me. I canceled the “ride” but THEY STILL TOOK THE MONEY FROM ME AS IF THEY GAVE ME A DRIVER!! THEY WERE STILL LOOKING FOR A DRIVER!!,07-12-2020 16:46
122,Uber is pricey,3,I think Uber is great and all and i have nothing to complain about of the drivers. However I find it annoying and money wasting that I can’t cancel a ride immediately without being fined. If the driver is hella far and I want to try to find another ride I can’t cancel right away without being charged. Lyft actually lets me cancel immediately if I didn’t want it. Lyft is more of a money saving than uber.,03-01-2021 06:35
123,Waiting fee,2,"I don’t like the fact that I cannot see how long before a driver arrives before it actually charges my card. Then, a driver can be on the way to another trip but at the same time “on the way” to pick you up. Very frustrating",08-01-2021 13:02
124,Bogus Offer,1,I tried using this app with the TRYXMAS30 promo code and it says I’m not eligible for this offer.,20-12-2020 01:45

126,Random Surges,2,"I always used Uber because it’s quick and reliable. However, the last few times I switched to Lyft. On two separate occasions, I had an Uber scheduled at around $30 & $40. Then, both times, I received a notification that there was a surge, so the prices were going to increase- understandable. Both times the cost went over $100, which I think is ridiculous. When I checked Lyft, it was around the $30 and $40 price range. Anyway, that’s my only issue with Uber recently.",30-11-2020 03:44
127,NOT GOOD SERVICE AT ALL,1,"Nobody but Uber drivers ask for money and tips and then fill someone type of way when u can’t I have other stuff to handle why should I pay I $15 to take me 9mins away 

They alas I charged me for a ride and cancelled on me right outside of my house took my money and it’s messed up I can’t talk to anyone about it I unsubscribe my Uber pass because there always says I owe then money never telling why 

U guys need to get a customer service team like ASAP I get lost a lot of money dealing with this app but am done!",23-11-2020 15:01
128,Customer service does not exist for fraudulent charges.,1,"Almost 200$ of fraudulent charges, they have no number to call, they do not respond to help requests. Worst service ever. Just use LYFT. Having to go through my back to block charges because no response from Uber.",05-01-2021 02:47
129,Greedy rise since pandemic,1,"This app used to be a very convenient way to get to & from work. But since the pandemic it seems like everyone’s taking advantage & hiking up prices by up to 5x. Seems a little ridiculous for a 5 minute ride to be $40-$50, especially when you work in the medical field & have patients waiting for you to treat them. Another day of missed work because there’s no benefit of paying so much just to work.",28-12-2020 15:30
130,No family option,3,"My app is current and downloaded , however I can’t add my 75 year old mom on a fixed income to my account. When I go to settings there is no “Family” option ! I have clicked on every option under settings— there is nothing about Family.",19-12-2020 03:07
131,No cars,1,"Used twice in the past and then when I really needed it there are no cars available. Then it tells me there is a error with my payment method. Don’t understand, it was the same as I used in the past! Ridiculous!!",27-11-2020 11:29
132,Fix your bug,3,ok so i ise uber to get to work 7/10 times a week. ive been experiencing a bug where i cant see how close or far my driver is. example: i got a driver and it says he'll be there in 13 minutes. ok cool so i wait and check 6 minutes later and it still says he'lll be there in 13 minutes. im like what the fuck its late im tryna go home after work yk so i send him this text and im like dude what the f?? are you coming or not? do i need to cancel? and then i check again and bam hes 1 minute away. i felt super bad and to make it worse he was an absolute sweetheart broken heart ,19-01-2021 05:21

135,Screw Uber,1,"On November 24, 2020, I landed at PDX and requested an Uber.  From my last fight two weeks ago, only Uber x drivers are allowed to pickup customers at the airport.  If you want to use the regular Uber, they direct you a quarter mile away for pickup.  This is a scam to make you pay for the more expensive Uber driver.  I never use them again.",25-11-2020 11:31
136,Love it but has been messing up,3,I been using Uber for a short time now and love it because it’s affordable but sometimes it tells me that my payment option won’t work even though I bought a Uber gift card,11-12-2020 04:01
137,Worst App I have ever seen!,1,"This App needs more intuitive user operations on allowing what Uber rewards  from the Uber credit card can be redeemed. It seems the App is totally disconnected from the Uber credit card but only focus on getting riders and eaters. There is no direct link or steps on how this App can be associated with the Uber credit card. It is a poor business model, many Uber customers would be disappointed, as a deceiving gimmick!

A Uber credit card user for three years",23-11-2020 21:19
138,3 stars,3,The app is very annoying it’s constantly moving my pick up spots even tho I have it programmed in. Drivers are never available unless you choose the more expensive option.

142,Uber takes advantage of loyal users,1,I have been a loyal customer with a 4.88 rating and have always said good things about them. I have not used Uber since the pandemic started and I noticed I was being charged for Uber pass without being signed up for it. Once I noticed I asked them to refund my money back to my credit card which they did for one of the two charges. They decided to give me a credit on my account which is not what I asked for. When I started telling people about this they had the same thing happen. I will never use them again because of this. They take advantage of loyal users.,10-12-2020 18:36
143,Just the worst,1,"It’s just so frustrating dealing with Uber. Pretty much every time I order a ride it put 2 holds on my card. Sometimes I just request a ride, it loads for a while, puts a hold on a card, keeps me waiting for minutes while Uber is allegedly “looking for a driver” and then it just throws me back to home page of the app. It’s impossible to reach support. Nope. Absolutely no way. Right now I’m trying to use my Tesla voucher listed as my payment method and Uber still keeps charging and double charging my card. I’d never go back to Uber if not for this voucher. Save yourself sometime and download Lyft or even call a regular cab - should be faster and cheaper",19-01-2021 07:27

No place for my gate code, driver sent request for it but it disappeared and I had no idea how to find it. To payment without tip, then tried to hit me up for tip afterwards. Already tipped driver cash since app keeps everything secret.

154,App support so poor I don’t want to use Uber,1,"I took a recent ride, and had an issue when trying to tip via the usual link within the app — I received some error about an issue with my payment. When I tried to resolve via Uber’s app support, I received generic replies with basic instructions on how to use the app, again and again, regardless of how I attempted to respond/explain. The lack of an ability to address a real problem that’s outside of the support template Uber has put together is frustrating to say the least, and is the reason I won’t be using Uber any longer.",27-11-2020 15:59

156,Can take forever to find a ride - Not for emergencies,2,"Uber drivers should NOT be allowed to set their own price—as they double what is the regular price for just a few blocks. There has to be a set money cap for distance.
I was going down a few blocks to my workplace, $10—said the estimation. Then as i’m awaiting a driver for them to pick, the drivers want to range the price up to $35.
I live in Koreatown, Los Angeles—hitching an Uber to PACOYMA is $30 —somehow going down a few blocks by USC should strike a value of $30?
Yeah, you got me messed up.
Some of these Uber drivers are straight up scammers..do not use this app in emergencies, as they will find away to push the price up $20 just for being grubby and incase of emergency you wont have the security of someone wanting to accept your price, you will simply be out an extra $20 because you needed to get to work, or maybe you were in what could be a suspicious situation.
Lyft. Use lyft. It can be cheaper, and they actually find you a ride in a timely manner.",17-01-2021 18:46

158,Few rides,1,I live outside of a big city (Charlotte NC) and can never find a ride. I’ve switched to Lyft and can get a ride within 15 minutes. Go with Lyft first,22-12-2020 05:11
159,Uber pass auto renew,1,"The week free trial of Uber Pass automatically charges you 24.99 as SOON as the week is over! No notification, BAD DESIGN.",20-11-2020 03:49
160,what the heck,1,This app just keeps randomly stealing my money. this past year has been hell. the worst bugs in the world. or maybe y’all have this do this on purpose. I know for a fact it’s illegal,22-11-2020 07:54
161,Why doesn't it work?,2,Because it doesn't work?,09-12-2020 21:10
162,Incorrect “Update Payment” Notifications,1,"The app keeps telling me to update my payment method - my credit card, saying that it is “about to expire.” However, my credit card doesn’t expire until 2024.

Can you please fix this? You guys are emailing me, sending notifications, etc, but you aren’t even correct about it. 

I already don’t want to support you because of Prop 22, but can you at least have a working app...?",14-12-2020 01:57
163,Family profile,1,Unfortunately I cannot add a family member for family sharing because the option does not show up in settings.  I have tried deleting the app and reinstalling  and the option in settings for family sharing is nonexistent,31-12-2020 23:09
164,Prices inflated,2,When I was on the app it told me $7-$15 estimated but in actuality it was $60. Just tell me the real price first. Also it took several minutes to even find a driver when there were 5 sitting at the Uber pick up at the airport.,20-12-2020 06:08
165,Drivers,2,Uber needs to stop letting drivers who are farther away than the actual distance of your destination. Had to wait 15-20 min to take a 5 min drive that completely missed my train,18-12-2020 18:03
166,Pricey,1,"Yes, this is a complaint. I was charged $24.99 per month and I do not remember signing up for an Uber pass. If I were Uber, I’d like to enforce a system to protect users from getting their credit card details stolen. There was fraud on my end and I do not appreciate how a company this big has bugs to fix. Fix this problem and if possible I’d like a refund.",01-12-2020 06:28
167,Horrible,1,I had to delete lift because the drivers never arrived or they are rude and now is the same with Uber they don’t show to the place are in bad mood and cancels the trip and on top of that Uber charge you bc he has to get something for the trip he make,19-12-2020 23:01
168,Not trustworthy,1,My card on file was used in San Francisco. Never been there. Reported fraud. I will never use Uber again,08-12-2020 05:38
169,Scheduled confirmation,2,You shouldn’t get a confirmation of a scheduled ride if there are no cars available. I confirmed a ride to the airport and it wasn’t until the car should have been there that it told me there wasn’t anyone available.,21-11-2020 10:33
170,Drivers Sitting Idle On Purpose,2,"If it were not for a good bit of drivers appearing to be on the way and then going to park somewhere and be idle, it would be alright. I can’t state enough how many times I’ve had to cancel and was charged a fee. It’s like they do it on purpose to collect free dollars or something. I don’t understand why they do that when it clearly asks them if they would like to accept the business or not.",14-01-2021 22:27
171,Can't sign in to existing account,1,As the title says. I put in my phone number and email. I'm told the email is already in use and don't give me an option to sign in... Great when you need it right now,31-12-2020 09:28
172,Update 14/01/2021: Support is horrible,1,"Been dealing with Uber support for over a week and it’s like a robot. Same response for them removing Family Profile and not realizing it.

Now it’s been over a month and they still haven’t realized Family Profile is missing.",14-01-2021 06:25
173,it was good,1,"The app is getting worse every day. Taking a long time to find drivers, when it does, the driver is far away or in the opposite direction.
I've been through horrible experiences, that's the problem with the lack of competition.",08-12-2020 04:32
174,Terrible cancel ride,1,Every time I order a ride it say it take longer than it expect then I cancel the ride it’s say I didn’t get charge but when I look at my bank account I did got charge for canceling the ride also I order a ride the prices get high hate this app,24-12-2020 01:53
175,Scheduled ride,1,There have been several times that I have scheduled a ride to be on time for work and your drivers just cancel the ride. Uber has literally caused me to be late several times and I think it’s pretty ridiculous that these drivers don’t get any kind of reprimand. If a driver except a ride that is scheduled they should not be able to cancel.,23-12-2020 10:59
176,Always showing wrong time and charge people money,2,"The time difference can be more then 10 mins, but continue showing wrong time estimate and charge people money",11-01-2021 00:16
177,I was charged $200 without authorization,1,"I requested an Uber for a short trip and they charged me for a cleaning fee and then another and another resulting in me being charged more than 200 dollars I asked for a refund and sent the proof and they do not want to give me the money back also every time I request an Uber He tells me an amount, I don't know why he reimbursed me, he charges me 15 dollars more, this has already happened to me several times, and I prefer not to use this app again because it has become a constant scam!!!!",05-01-2021 18:51
178,Worst ever app,1,There driver will cancel when you asked him to wait for you and put huge bill on you. The annoying part is that they will force you to use Uber card to pay for the cancellation and not allow you to pay the next driver.,02-12-2020 16:08
179,Great app but racist driver,4,My boyfriend needed a ride home from work and his Uber driver canceled because he was Arabic. Love the app and how it connects people but canceling a ride because of someone’s culture is disgusting.,16-01-2021 13:41
180,Idiot!,1,Worst App ever and you are THIEVES!!!,01-01-2021 23:59
181,Bad rating system.,2,I should not penalized for the length of wait time for pickup. GPS drop off locations are rarely correct.,21-01-2021 00:44
182,"Loving the new app, but not the customer support",5,"Love the new interface and Uber for Business tied directly to my companies expenses.  Great job!

Unfortunately, the inability to actually contact Uber directly and being forced to look through a list of glorified FAQs is not good customer support. If your issue is not in the predefined list you’re basically out of luck since their no one you can contact for help unless you’re a driver.",07-12-2020 17:40
183,Great except when most needed,1,"Works fine often enough, but when things get busy the app keeps promising a ride is nearby, but then it vaporizes without  explanation or apology. Much better luck with Lyft app. Also, the drivers rate you down even when you rate them well.",29-12-2020 01:24
184,Don’t use for Uber eats.,2,"I’ve used this app for Uber eats a couple times now and my order is either always wrong or never gets delivered. I don’t know if they just use terrible drivers or if there is an issue with the app itself. But for food, don’t use Uber eats.",16-01-2021 20:06
185,UberEats app UI is bad,1,"Uber main app is great but the integrated UberEats has many features missing and is buggy: can’t call driver, help button sometime doesn’t work, etc.",26-11-2020 07:13
186,A wonderful app most of the time,4,"This app works with me 90% of 50% of the time, and it’s amazing when it does. It’s saved my job a time or three, because I have a bad habit of leaving my wallet at home. However, it seems that it often leaves me hanging when I need a ride. Usually I can find a ride anyways but still, I have a 5-star rating and I seriously still can’t get a ride, just because I’m not going out-of-state? I can’t always pester a friend to drive me around, but I guess I was mistaken believing that this app would be consistent. Again, wonderful app but it seems to fail me a lot.",01-01-2021 02:03
187,Good Luck,1,"A couple years ago I was traveling out of state and when I attempted to order a ride it said my account was locked due to unusual use (may be a neat security feat. but it was my first time using the app so there was nothing to compare to). Either way, it left me stranded for a few hours while I was trying to work with the robot that is Customer Service, finally I gave up an called for a taxi service. That night I explained that I was traveling and it was me, they said they would fix the problem and DISABLED my account. Fast forward to today trying to get this to work again, after dealing with “customer service” again for the past week going in circles with the robot responses, their final email to me states they are deciding to not life the hold to an account I’ve never been able to use and have given no explanations for anything yet. If it were possible to give 0/5 stars, I would.",16-01-2021 16:25
188,Robbed by a driver,1,"I use Uber to get to my job at an assisted living facility. Come to find out a driver falsely said I’d left something in his car. Apparently this cost me 15 dollars but never left anything in a car. Apparently when you are robbed the clock starts ticking when Uber will even review your complaint. Apparently I was too late and this driver got away with robbing me. Guess being too busy caring for the elderly during a pandemic to double or triple check their drivers aren’t stealing from customers is not a good enough reason but hey they told me if it happens again be a bit faster with my complaint . If it happens again?! 
Update: Support reached out after telling me tough luck a number of times. Will keep results posted here. Update: so first they say nothing they can do after 30 days and now it 90 days. Uber is allowing their drivers to steal from customers. Horrible service.",02-01-2021 06:54
189,Drivers,1,"So one driver I had was pretty nice, but decided to not end the trip after dropping me off, charged me 30 dollars for a 8 dollar trip, and most of the drivers are ok and I thought this was a one time thing. Nope, most of them accept the trip and don’t even show up! I needed to get to work quickly and after 20 minutes of them going somewhere else, I said screw it. Lyft is way better!",03-01-2021 20:08
190,Always taking money,1,"This app has a lot of bugs , it seems like all they care about is money (duhh) if your driver can’t find you it charges you $5.. if you get over charged they don’t guarantee you will get your money back. I was charged twice for a $20 ride I never got. It was extremely difficult to find where I was even supposed to put my claim in at. When I finally did they didn’t even give my money back...that’s $40 and I had to find a ride home that night because I didn’t have enough money left to order a lyft. Will not get another dime out of me. ..... Trash customer service!!face with symbols on mouth ",05-01-2021 20:24
191,Unavailable,1,I’m not sure if it’s the terms and conditions but the destinations that I ALWAYS go to are unavailable now. I can no longer use Uber.,19-01-2021 00:03
192,Broken,1,"I had an emergency and needed to use this app. I tried putting in my debit card information, then it hit me with “Payment method unavailable. This payment method is unavailable at the moment. Please switch your payment method to request a ride.” I’m using a BoA Debit Card which is a common payment method! Why is Uber not letting me pay with that card? When going to Uber support, all they tell you is “You’re probably putting your payment info in wrong” all my stuff is correct! And if that doesn’t work, they tell you to “buy an Uber gift card OR use another payment method” WHAT?? They are making me jump through hoops just to get a ride. That’s it, I’m just going to use Lyft instead. STAY FAR AWAY FROM UBER",28-11-2020 18:44
193,I will never not be late,1,"I rely on Uber to get to work every morning, and no matter what I do, no matter how early I order I am always late. It’s absolutely unacceptable.",19-12-2020 22:43
194,Problems with Bikes,2,With the update the option to rent bikes is not working. Consistently getting a “sorry” message and no bikes appearing on the app,11-12-2020 18:03
195,Years of loyalty stripped away,1,I had been using Uber ever since it’s creation. I’ve relied on it to get to and from work especially during the pandemic as a essential worker. I was a diamond member and I monthly pass user and Uber Pass User. Most recently my debit card was stolen which lead to me unlinking my card when the new card came it was hacked and being used as a Master Card instead of a Visa. I reached out to customer service and they basically told me to unlink all of my methods of payment and to try to re link  methods of payment that would work. Someone even asked me to send pictures of the debit and credit cards I was trying to use.  Uber blocked me from linking any payments and being able to use my app. It’s been over a week and I’ve had to rely on other ride app shares that aren’t of quality or service. Uber customer service claims my case is pending.... while it’s pending I’m left with only lyft ride share app to use in my area which is typically more expensive and their drivers struggle to find their riders even with gps assistance. This has been a terrible experience especially considering how long I’ve been a loyal customer of Uber. I’m highly dissatisfied and disappointed,05-01-2021 14:03
196,A horrible company,1,"I think I understand why Uber drivers are not treating customers well. The CEOs of Uber are taking I think 30 to 35% of their payment, consequently there mistreating customers including lowering my rating as well.I think I’m going to start using a private car service instead of your cheap labor to the drivers rides. I’m not the only one that beer is this treatment. I’m sure a lot of customers are feeling this as well. In the beginning Uber used to treat me very well, but as time went on it became worse. I also don’t understand why my ratings keep going down. I’m always outside 99% of the time, very kind to the drivers, and A lot of times tip the drivers. I went from a 4.88 a year and a half ago and now I am a 4.64 dropping tremendously every day.It’s not only you it’s lyft as well.",03-12-2020 20:01
197,Mexico Uber,1,i live in mexico for over than 2 years didnt have a problem using uber but some of the days when I have to go where I need to go they don't pick up because of pesos are very low. so they wait until the price is high to answer the request,19-11-2020 16:23
198,No way to contact customer service if issues arise,1,You guys need to have a customer service phone line to contact if issues arise and persist! This is poor service trying to get help through articles that don’t help the exact issue we have!,19-01-2021 21:04
199,Price gouging,2,After needing a ride from the airport within 5 minutes the price went from $31 to $57. Just tired of business ripping people off and over charging.,28-12-2020 14:57
200,Festival,1,So I recently took a ride and some driver couldn’t complete the ride cuz it was too far for him. He wanted me to camel the ride but it would charge me extra money to pay him for doing nothing. The reasoning for the fee was “pay him for the time he wasted.” He wasted my time. I shouldn’t have to pay some guy who didn’t complete the services I would’ve payed him for. This is a feature that Lyft does way better. They’ll let the driver cancel if they need too or let the rider cancel without any fees because you shouldn’t pay for a service you didn’t receive.,18-12-2020 12:43
201,Fix the Uber Cash,1,Fix the Uber Cash.,08-12-2020 21:09
202,No happy,1,Why you are charging me monthly after I have stop auto renewal and and why you are charging me more amount for subscription,20-01-2021 02:18
203,Oh idk,3,"Why do y’all send me Uber’s that are all the way in Edmond and I live on the south I’m
Always late to work do y’all need more drivers or something !?? Other than that I love it the drivers are friendly but the timing is TERRIBLE.",09-01-2021 22:57
204,Customer service,2,"The app is terrible when it come to help , they act like you are getting help from a person when its really a automated service and then they don't even resolve the problem thats very resolve-able lyft is better tbh",19-01-2021 14:17
205,High prices,1,"Uber is ridiculous. They charge you a lot more when it’s busy. I got charged $22 for a 7 minute ride, the original price was $10. I’ve had Uber for a couple years now and they NEVER charged me more bc it was busy. It started during the pandemic which I think is so dumb and unfair. Never disliked a ride app this much until now.",19-11-2020 22:38
206,No cars,2,It’s convenient sometimes but when you need them there’s really no cars out,20-12-2020 17:17
207,Payment Glitch???,1,I was charged $24.99 for something that I never confirmed. I put in a help request but am not getting much of a response. Please help!,17-01-2021 21:29
208,Above,1,Why are there no riders all of a sudden hmmm face with monocle ,03-01-2021 01:47
209,Charging for cancellation,3,"I scheduled an Uber for 8:45-8:50. My driver came 20 minutes early. So I told him I’ll be out at 8:45 because that’s the time I scheduled for. He canceled and left. So when I canceled the Uber, they charged me for canceling when my driver was the one who left. Every time I scheduled an Uber, the driver wants me to leave 20 minutes early. I scheduled one for a reason, not to be at work 20 minutes early. I’ve been using Uber for years and since this scheduling has become a thing, drivers are being more impatient. They can see the time I scheduled for, yet they rush me to leave extremely early.",16-01-2021 13:36
210,Was attacked and charged for ride wasn’t in,1,I was waiting for my uber and was attacked and had my phone stolen. I was still charged for the uber and when I contacted support I was told that if I would not receive a refund and told “please be aware excessive or false refund and adjustment requests violate our refund policies and may result in the denial of future requests.” You think they would have some sympathy for someone who was attacked waiting for them to arrive.,11-01-2021 02:13
211,This is a prepaid phone and they can't wrap their heads around that,1,I just got this number and it was already registered to Uber from the previous person. Uber won't let me sign up with this number it keeps asking me to try to login and obviously I can't do that.  Customer support sends me the same generic message again and again they don't read my responses,26-11-2020 16:42
212,Awful,1,"Don’t waste your time with this app. They will not protect your privacy or security. They literally do not care. I went back and forth with Uber support when my account got hacked and all they did was send me the same scripted responses over and over. Eventually they stopped responding. I had to call the bank and cancel my card since Uber didn’t care to help me. Now theres someone out there using my name when they get Ubers. I could go on about horrible experiences with Uber. Just get Lyft, it’s FAR better.",11-01-2021 02:01
213,Lame,1,It was cool until they started tripling the price. Who’s gonna spend 60 dollars for a 9 mile ride? Lyft gain a customer. You guys lost one,26-11-2020 11:21
214,Scam scam scam,1,"Uber charged me for a ride a didn’t take for $30. After I emailed them 3x, and they refused the refund, they then accused me of making false statements. That’s just insulting and not customer service. I have been a customer since day 1 and spent thousands of dollars over the years with no complaints and this was the first time I had a dispute. I had a 4.86 rating so clearly no issues in the past. They lost a customer and I will be taking Lyft or via from now on. Don’t get scammed by them! ",28-12-2020 04:28
215,Thank you,5,Thank you to have created that app and put all The efforts and creativity to it,16-12-2020 19:57
216,Not able to schedule,1,I’m not able to schedule a ride. The app asks what payment I want to use to schedule a ride but it will not let me choose the option.,18-12-2020 22:31
217,Not enough drivers,1,"No matter where I am, or what time it is there’s never “drivers in my area” whenever I need to Uber",02-01-2021 02:22
218,"Dark, Greedy Interface Patterns",1,"The interface for ordering food within this application is overly rigid and forces the user into inconvenient situations when you need to edit an order.
 I was placing an order for delivery with my girlfriend (on her phone) and was at a different address than the last place we had ordered food from. Uber auto filled the address with the most recent and then, when I confirmed my order, gave me a two second timer to cancel with a warning saying “it looks like you’re not located near this delivery address”. I missed the cancel window (of literally two or three seconds) and then the app finalized the order and when I went to change the address, it would not allow me. When I went to cancel and reorder with the proper address, it said the fee would be $50 ( total cost of food minus fees). Mind you this is all within a minute of me placing the order, not 10 minutes after. 
What is this garbage? I know from ordering pickup through Uber (where Uber doesn’t collect fees) that I have to click TWO confirmation modals to confirm that I want pickup over delivery. Why then, when someone is clearly not near their selected delivery location, does Uber auto-confirm the order and then prevent any changes to the delivery address? This is clearly a tactic used to force users to keep their orders even when a mistake was made. How about adding a simple form to the application to change the order address? I’m a software developer and know that this was a decision made by a product team that chose higher revenue over customer satisfaction. That is a long term recipe for failure and loss of customer loyalty. I’m deleting this application. Good riddance",12-12-2020 00:46
219,I'm annoyed,1,There have already been several times that I have been overcharged in this application now they are charging me more than forty dollars more I want my money back,21-12-2020 20:59
220,Deceitful pricing surge caused me to leave Uber,1,"I was ordering a trip back home after dinner with family. The price listed was what I would expect, around $37. I order the ride, and this amount get charged to my card. The I see a pop up say that my ride will be more expensive. I accept, because I assume it a reasonable increase. However, THE APP NEVER SHOWS ME THE ACTUAL PRICE after the increase. It is only when I get home that I realize that my card has been charged an additional $127. I reach out to customer service, but I only get canned responses basically telling they are right to do that and to basically F off. This way of up charging felt deceptive and unethical. Had I been shown the final price after a BS 5x charge I would have immediately declined. 

Buyer beware of shady practices and obfuscated pricing increases!",30-11-2020 01:52
221,Give drivers rights,1,Shameful political lies and manipulation from uber and other deleting this,17-12-2020 17:27
222,Probably the worst customer service experience I’ve ever had,1,I’ve been getting charged $10 a month from uber for some pass I’ve never purchased and when I try to reach out and call customer service they told me to go on the app and of course I do. They take forever to respond or once they respond quickly they keep on switching people and telling me to do this and that to cancel the pass even though I’ve clearly told 10 people the same thing and even sent screenshots like I don’t understand what to do anymore,16-12-2020 08:30
223,problem with drivers,3,"The problem with the application has always been that the drivers make you wait a long time and in the end they just cancel, there should be a way to regulate that more",24-12-2020 03:00
224,It’s not good,1,"So many things with this app

I got charged twice for the same trip,
People can cancel on you even if they’re in the wrong location, they also charge your account a couple dollars without notice.",17-01-2021 00:37
225,nonconformity,2,"This App does not respect the agreed price, at the end of the trip the cost is higher than what is established, in the city of Queretaro the price is always changing, the more they ask for the more the trip costs and in other cities it is not like that, they should give the option to choose the driver, to be able to decide if I want to travel with him or not, since they assign drivers who are remote or with a bad reputation, fix that",03-12-2020 14:00
226,Guys,1,I’m getting upset with this one day y’all be taking $22 and then another day u take money of me I don’t know what’s going on I’m will like my money back and I’m not using this app no more,14-01-2021 14:46

I just hate when I request a ride and I cancel it because the driver hasn’t move for 10 minutes and they charge me anyway.",01-01-2021 04:23
228,Wow extreme waste of time.,1,"Expect extreme wait times and a complete lack of effort to find actually helpful drivers. This app will show you a price and the expand it’s price to obscene numbers, I do not recommend this app I actually recommend removing the option so you have less headache to deal with in the long run. The worst part is that they won’t refund you anything at all no matter how in the right you are unless you fight tooth and nail to make them follow their own policies. 0/10",22-12-2020 08:50

231,Really?.,1,"I set up a ride a whole day before because I needed a ride to the airport I admit my house is a little far, it is outside the city that is why I scheduled beforehand. So I’m waiting, the pickup time comes around and it tells my no drivers are available and to schedule another ride. So now, I miss my flight. I have no reference on the Uber driver version and that is why all of a sudden no drivers are available at my pickup time but I think there needs be something fixed in this grey area.",19-12-2020 14:52
232,Wrong person picked up-refund refused,1,Customer service is terrible and there is no # to talk to someone. The driver picked up the wrong person and I was not able to get a refund I will not use this app again.,19-01-2021 04:45
233,Wait times are wildly inaccurate,3,Your Uber wait time will stick at 1 minute away die 5 minutes. You’d think they would update this as this is one of the most popular apps. Other than that it’s great,24-11-2020 18:19
234,The surcharge is at least 40$ when it’s busy,1,The fact that y’all add and remove Uber saver when y’all want upsets me...,19-11-2020 19:51
235,Worst customer service of all time,1,I really am not one to write app reviews but the customer service associated with the uber app has been a nightmare. I have been trying to get an issue resolved that stemmed from an error with their app redeeming uber cash from uber credit card rewards. They just continuously send the same automated messages and they tried to mark my issue as resolved multiple times without ever doing anything about it. On top of it all I am an uber gold member so this is allegedly their “priority support”. Really the worst customer service I have ever dealt with.,03-01-2021 19:39
236,Only use for short rides,3,"Anything longer than a few miles is going to stack up fast. Don’t even bother using the food section, you can’t cancel orders from the Uber app. You have to download UberEats to cancel any order, but just use DoorDash instead. It’s quicker, cheaper, and doesn’t Mickey Mouse you trying to cancel an order because there’s no drivers. I got $30 off a $34 order and still wound up having to pay $25 in fees. Then when I cancelled because my order was in limbo for two hours, I was charged a $6 cancellation fee where DoorDash gives you credit back. Wouldn’t recommend, just take the bus.",20-01-2021 00:25
237,This site is horrible!!!,1,"How do I delete my account, all I wanted to do is check a price from here to there, ... have a feeling I may have a $200+ charge!!  I have tried everything.
Please help... after paying $10 to go less than 1 mile, the driver was going to let me at this store that was very busy, (normally not!) so I felt I had to slide him more $$ like $12, plus tip on my card!  I had several ppl say “next time CALL ME!!!” lol, yeah, next time I will walk... face with symbols on mouth ",13-01-2021 10:48
238,Just you,1,"I started using Uber about 5 years ago when I lived in Miami. It wasn’t great then, but it’s surprisingly declined as far as service. There could be a driver near me, gets my ride, then cancels once they see the distance of my trip. That’s very disappointing, especially when the weathers bad. So therefore, most of my driver are more than 15 minutes away. And sometimes, they even cancel. If we could flag drivers, that would be helpful. I don’t want to be paired with someone determined to go south, when I’m headed north. Do better Uber",28-12-2020 19:23
239,Timing,1,God forbid you have to get an Uber to work u will be late even if you pay for ur driver to get there faster and confirm your ride 20 mins before DELETING,09-01-2021 18:52
240,Awesome,5,"App Store. People looking to download the app.
 After years of using the service Uber I must say they never let me down. I currently hold a 4.97 rating and my drivers really represent that. Holding each other to a certain standard when driving is important. As well as mutual respect. With uber being such a simple app to navigate really anyone can use it. It offers the change to also make the right choice. aAfter a night of drinking with buddies you can get a safe, reliable ride home using this app. This is the first time something like this has been available. OF course we have taxi service but it is not the same. Drivers often offer free water and phone charger upon arrival. After being out, charging your phone is a real treat due to it generally being dead. Not only do they have regular rides you can select different vehicle options at different price points. If you need a car for a larger party you can select that when placing your pickup location. For example you're spending the day snowboarding. On the app you can request a car with a ski rack to store your gear for a warm ride back to your lodge. Another advantage to it is you see the price of the ride before it's placed so it's not a surprise. All together I really enjoy this app as a safe way to travel and a reliable way as well. I would strongly recommend it and therefore I give it a 5 star rating.",07-12-2020 22:43
241,Pathetic customer service,1,"For a company as popular as Uber you would think there would be an easy way to talk to someone so they can help fix a problem with their service. I had a lot of faith in Uber’s ability to get me from the airport home but, I had a ridiculous experience today. While at lax I tried to get a ride home today and it said the price would be 41-49$ so I requested a ride. Then as I waited at the Uber pickup they couldn’t seem to find me a driver, for nearly an hour I waited until they found one but it was 165$. So I declined the up charge. After a few ridiculous prices surcharges offers by the app I eventually agreed to take a ride for 81$. I had been waiting for about an hour an a half so I took the nearly 2x price of what they kept showing me on my phone when initially requested a ride. Now I had a nice driver and don’t want his promised money taken away but, I agreed to a pay 81$ price but they charged my card for 87$. In the grand scheme it’s not that much money difference but I think it’s ridiculous that they don’t have a system to even hear me out so I can explain what happened. It’s terrible that you can agree to a certain price and be charged something else without any way of it being challenged. I went through all of the different support options on the app and they wouldn’t do anything. Please give a phone number I can contact you at or something because this is ba and while I understand surge pricing is the whole business model I don’t think it’s part of the business model to change the price of the ride once you have already taken it.",04-01-2021 08:31
242,Annoying,1,This app constantly lies to you about how long it’s going to take you to get picked up. Also will mislead on price of rice. Lyft isn’t great either most times I would rather walk,04-01-2021 02:08
243,Uber keep charging people for rides canceled by there driver!,1,I complained to Uber that there driver had me standing outside my house after which time they did not no where they were going. They she canceled the ride. I get charged for it they gonna tell me it’s for the persons time. I disputed it through PayPal they returned my money then they gonna put on my account that I owe $5.44 free money they want to give to they driver. I take Uber everywhere in a short time I became a gold member an moving to the next level. Because I refused to pay for service I did not get my account was stripped. After she canceled one of there same driver picked me up at the same location.,12-12-2020 00:19
244,Took money without knowledge,1,Never got an email or anything but they decided they wanted to sign me up for the uber pass and take my money without me knowing nor do I even use this app. Have been trying to get ahold of someone for 3 days and still can’t find a help number or anything! It’s ridiculous I can’t get in touch with anyone your help menu is the most useless thing I’ve ever had to try to use. By far the worst company I’ve ever dealt with. Apple never do this and gives me my money back. Your on something.,02-12-2020 23:34
245,Highway robbery,1,Lastnight I paid $40 for a Uber to the airport 2 hours before my plane left Uber canceled ride on me and then second Uber drove so slow I missed my plane but don’t worry guess what I had another Uber cancel my ride back to my house and then a fourth Uber was doing 20 over the speed limit the whole way home for another $40 not including my plane ticket Uber has taken it’s sticky fingers and bled me dry I would not recommend this app to anyone and if you absolutely need a taxi use LYFT instead,17-12-2020 16:34
246,Wheel chair vehicles not practical for some,2,"Your app doesn't have a place for me to send feedback in detail, and when there’s not an option for what is my problem so I’m here publicly giving my feedback, stupid it is. I keep getting paired wheel chair vans, and I don’t know until they show up... these vehicles are very uncomfortable for me to sit in actually, the seats are all the way at the back and are high high up my feet have nowhere to rest they don’t touch the ground and your head hits the top of the ceiling so you bunch the whole ride . I have back problems and if we were to get hit I wouldn’t be safe at all. I could see this vehicle being useful for wheel chair bound people’s but for me it’s really not practical. I had only three bags of groceries and there wasn’t room to put them in the trunk (there isn’t really a trunk) so we put them on the floor but they were sliding all around it was uncomfortable/ stressful, you charge 13 for short rides and I get in this car. I’m starting to use Lyft now, mostly because there was no where at least within reason to give feedback on the app. I get that these vehicles are around but I don’t want to be paired with one in the future you need to let people type feedback. You’re list of problems isn’t enough. I used to love uber easy, not as expensive, and normal rides. I think you could put “wheel chair vehicle” in the title of the car so I could cancel. Or make it so I could opt out of that type of car and not get paired. Someone who needs a wheel chair ride could have used it and enjoyed it. I got paired with one twice in a week.",20-01-2021 18:56
247,Ridiculous,2,Now I have to contact customer support if I want to make any changes to my account? LOL it’s getting to the point where I just wanna walk. Uber and Lyft are starting to be pathetic. And y’all only reply to the good reviews which says a lot.,14-12-2020 12:41
248,Guys stop using Uber.,1,"I’m a Uber platinum member and Uber is wasting my time and my money. I have to wait cumin 15mins or 20mins to skip those. Greedy nasty driver who wants to overcharge me all the time. It’s not even double it’s filing 4x more than what I should pay for even taxi is way more economic and faster.
Guys just use Lyft instead of garbage Uber.
I had enough time with this trash greedy company and drivers.
Uber always keep your mom till the day their mother pass away.",07-01-2021 00:53
249,Payment issue,1,Thanks to Uber not accept my card I can not book a ride anymore cause I try to put my card back in and it says payment issue not accept my card which isn't fair I don't have other cards I'm not rich I use Uber sometimes up to 5-6 times a week sometime twice a day now I can't get nothing,30-12-2020 07:17
250,Not good,1,Can do better,10-12-2020 22:44
251,They overcharge,1,So I took Uber from San Diego to Anaheim it had originally said my price would be between $104-$127 but they ended up charging me $546.55 because they added 5x surcharge and to top it off it was Christmas 12/25 my birthday they ruined my birthday with this high charge. I tried to call customer service but they only have a phone line for drivers not for riders they make it extremely hard to contact them I am so unpleased will never use Uber again.,30-12-2020 04:16
252,Promotions are fake,1,"I got a promotion code 1 hour ago. I clicked the link in the email. It took me to Uber. I entered the promotion code in the email. It said ""the promotion code expired"". This is the third time this happened. I'm sick of these fake emails and how Uber tries to trick me.",21-11-2020 23:25
253,Worst customer support,2,Uber has TERRIBLE customer support. It’s just a sea of bots pasting the same message over and over even if the message does nothing to address your concerns. It takes a long time and there’s no option to contact them by phone.,10-01-2021 00:39
254,The Time frames are a lie.,1,Also the “peak” times and most of their rates are artificially inflated. Good luck getting any service from the corporation.,11-01-2021 04:49
255,So disappointed with Uber!,1,"Today my mother needed a ride to the city from el Reno to Oklahoma City and I couldn’t get her a ride from Uber, it said no cars available! Really Uber? I thought I could count on a big company like Uber! So disappointed!",06-01-2021 19:43
256,NOT TO BE TRUSTED!!!!!! SCAMMERS!!!!!,1,Doesn’t even deserve the one star but not allowed to go lower. I’ve never wrote a review before today but at this point I feel like my hand was forced. So it’s write this then complain to the BBB. My card was charged twice even though they tried three times. Of course there is no one to call so you can cancel the transaction. Also while trying to go online to find out if I had any other options I found other people who were taken advantage of the same way for all different amounts. TOTALLY NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!!,10-01-2021 09:45
257,Tariffs,1,"Check your account statement every time you take a trip that will double your charge.
This happens constantly in Monterrey, Mexico.",21-11-2020 19:20
258,Just keeps getting worse,1,"Uber gets worse every time I use it. App says a driver is a few minutes away, confirm my ride and then it says no drivers available. Last time I used them they charged me $45 to go approximately 8 miles because of “busy times”. Guess I’ll start using Lyft.",09-01-2021 00:00
259,Bad faith upfront pricing,1,They secretly change your upfront pricing and there’s no way to tell how much it was unless you remember! They’ll secretly charge you more,24-11-2020 22:34
260,Canceled and charged me,1,Uber cancelled a pre scheduled ride for college kid trying to get to airport less than an hour before his scheduled ride. Said he had to add preloaded funds which we did repeatedly. Cancelled again. Poor kid had to beg another student to miss class to take him to the airport. No one to call at uber. No one to help. Made our day very frustrating and stressful. Now trying to get our $25 back from uber.  Shameful.,24-11-2020 17:34
261,No wrinkles available,3,I have not been able to see what going on with my Uber app they are running and my location is on. But December 31st I was not able to get a ride or quickly come home because my app says “ No Cars I available” And for some reason it still says that and it’s January 7th. I need help I don’t t know what’s going on!!!,07-01-2021 07:23
262,payment,1,not sure why you aren’t able to use cash app or prepaid card... very inconvenient.,27-11-2020 02:45
263,Horrible international brand,1,"Uber should consider going out of business. Their customer service support is absolute rubbish! Their drivers are rude and nonchalant and make you wait long intervals to be picked up. They lack the skill and orientation to run a international buisness. Uber is so much better in America, specifically smaller states like R.I and M.A when you get to bigger states like N.Y.C and Lagos Nigeria the customer service drops. One day I will get into Uber and record all of the mishaps with Uber and post it online because that seems like the only way they will consider customers feedback and make the necessary changes",26-11-2020 12:02
264,Okay,4,"The Nip that we enter when we arrive with the diner should be for all diners in general since there are people who, even if their products are delivered, they mark them as not if they were not delivered...",20-01-2021 21:34
265,Many issues,1,"I’m sorry but I can’t rate it higher then 2 stars. I’ve had many many issues using this app.
It’s more an inconvenience to me then anything. Since I live in an area not close to many Uber drivers it’s harder for me to even get a ride.
Most of the time it’ll stay at the “connecting you to a driver” stage then fail to even connect me to one anyways. 
I’m not even able to even schedule a ride if I could because it’ll usually tell me the pick up area is out of range. 
If some of those issues were fixed maybe I could give it a higher rating.
Now also giving me problems adding funds to my Uber cash even though I know I have enough money to add more funds.",19-01-2021 02:31
266,Trash,1,Very Horrible Service,27-11-2020 18:09
267,Love it,4,Love the app but lately it’s been saying no cars available.. Not sure if it’s a glitch or just due to the pandemic.,30-12-2020 20:18
268,Not user friendly,1,I hate it almost every time I have to use it,30-11-2020 14:33
269,I’m late all the time,1,"You guys take forever finding me a ride when I schedule well in advance and I need to get to work and I am ALWAYS late no matter if I schedule it an hour ahead or 30 min ahead. But you guys get me there which is what matters. I just don’t find it reliable and fast you claim it. Your uber eats is awesome though:)
Also, your drivers are far away all the time and I wait longer than what the app says because YOUR DRIVERS ARENT MOVING!!!",12-12-2020 20:03
270,Surge pricing is unfair,1,"Surge pricing is awful. It doubles the price of an already expensive trip, plus every time I pay for surge I get a driver instantly and when It’s not surge it takes forever to get a driver and sometimes they cancel. I feel like they are doubling the price to bump others out of their que and that’s not right.",20-12-2020 20:30
271,Wonderful driver and I can’t tip them!!,1,"I cannot tip in app at all without error messages, so no tip for my great driver. I was ready to contact support, but it is difficult to find a way to contact Uber for customer service. No phone number, no email, and the help section of the app is just help articles. Not using if it won’t let me help these drivers make the money they deserve!",11-01-2021 22:21
272,Unnecessary Hassle,1,I should not have to go through hoops to update my phone number. For this reason alone I haven’t used Uber in over 2 years. Guess I will continue not to since I refuse to create another account,24-11-2020 15:59
273,Can’t schedule rides,1,"What’s the point of having the option if every time you select it , it shows your payment options and when you click them it doesn’t even respond. I’d like to be able to schedule a ride in advance rather than on whenever the driver decides to show up and pray it makes it on time of when I need to leave",20-01-2021 08:03
274,No customer service at all,1,"Uber doesn’t have any customer survive. No phone, no email, no chat.",23-12-2020 04:27
275,Great but one thing....,4,"Used to be 5 stars, now 4. Had someone cancel a trip on me (never saw them), and got a response from Uber that said “Your driver said you were not wearing a face cover or mask”
First off, no one ever showed up.
Second, I was wearing an n95 mask...
Third, there is no way to let Uber know that I was wearing a mask... sounds like a loophole in the app. I’m guessing the real reason they cancelled was because they didn’t want to drive me to the airport (which is fine), but Uber, please don’t send me a long email lecturing me on wearing a mask, when I was, and then not give me a way to dispute it. Otherwise, app is 5/5!",22-11-2020 16:44
276,No current customer service,3,"I like uber and used to use it frequently when we were allowed to go out. I have had so many issues recently with the app deleting my payment methods, or not allowing me to schedule a pickup. When you go on the app or website there’s no actual option for speaking to representative. It’s all just quick links. Seems like they don’t actually have a desire to help a customer in need.",13-01-2021 22:07

280,Overcharged too many times. TRASH SERVICE,1,"I can understand when Uber tells me my ride will be between 32 and $35 but somehow later we end up with a $52 charge and then the next day it happens again and my credit from the previous issues wasn’t applied!  I’ve been dealing with Uber for a years, and honestly it’s more of a hassle than benefit! I’ll just use Lyft.  I’m just trying to get to work and they’re taxing every chance they get!!",24-11-2020 16:01
281,Service is getting worse each day!!!,1,"Your drivers are behaving bad, they cancel the trips and we users have to accept that without any consideration... but when we cancel a Trip because driver is delaying to much, you ask us for a “Cancellation Fee” to honor the driver???

Tried to get my money back and I just received a credit which I think it’s really unfair, there’s no number or email to contact. Not using this app again.

284,Worst experience,1,"Never write reviews but tonight I am. I ordered my Uber and was picked up when I got in the car I was told that he couldn’t take me to my destination because I was supposed to be his last ride and he lives in the opposite direction. He told me I have to cancel this and you can get someone else. 
Idk how Uber driver app works however if the driver submits that he will be heading home why send him a ride that is out of the way but also the driver should have declined it because I would assume that it reveals my destination. 
This was absolutely terrible terrible service!",19-12-2020 02:40
285,I no longer use Uber,1,I haven’t used Uber and a couple of months. I’ve been trying to stop the subscription. I’m not getting any luck AT ALL so far I’ve lost $48 in two months and I haven’t used the service. It’s practically impossible to speak to a human everything is over the phone and the Internet so there’s no human connection. I don’t have 24+ dollars to donate to a service that I don’t use anymore I need help!! I want to stop my service I will no longer use Uber I’d rather go to Lyft. This is huge inconvenience for me. Uber was quick to stop my service  they thought I was another customer who gave a driver a hard time.I couldn’t get a ride until a number I wasn’t able to call back (Uber)called me to dispute a situation I had nothing to do with. I just want to stop the service you all are stealing from me at this point and I’m sick of it and I want my money back.,09-01-2021 20:56
286,Need -no smokers- car option,3,"There have been many times that I’ve gotten into a car where the driver was a heavy smoker. And for me to cancel and then order another Uber, after already waiting 20 mins, would make me late. They need to create a better way. I understand you can text the driver and request a non smoking vehicle but they don’t always read their messages.",31-12-2020 17:56
287,Payment bug for 2 weeks,1,For the last 2 weeks I can’t make a payment on Uber eats. It’s won’t accept any of my payment methods or cards even tho they work elsewhere.

291,About issues,2,"I sold my car, live in DC, and use Uber a lot. 
Also while traveling. 
Usually things work out well, but wanted to give some feedback to the company. Not sure how to otherwise. 
I’m having frequent issues with the driver “arriving “ but not where I am. Perhaps 100 yards down the street. But not at the specified address. Happened last night in Park City, and again today at Dulles airport. App said I should wait at “3F”, but driver called me from some random nearby parking lot. 
The worst was this morning, I had arranged, the night before, for a 7:00 am pick up at my hotel. Come 7 am, no Uber, and none seemed to be available. Ended up having to pay $135 to get a limo to the airport. Please, as I have learned, don’t assume you can expect them to show up even though you have pre-ordered a ride. They need to be more up front about these things, and I blame the app, and not necessarily the driver, hence my writing this review on the Apple App Store.",13-12-2020 01:18

293,Last Choice in East Africa — Unable to provide feedback to Uber on Issues,1,"In Mombasa the app messes up completely when wanting to go to the southern part of the city (Likoni). 
Twice I’ve been charged triple for a trip from Mombasa to Likoni as it calculates a 50km trip instead of using the ferry which is how we always cross. When contacting Uber they respond that I accepted to amount when booking the ride (which is true as Uber used to correct fare if a different route was taken). 

You are unable to review a driver that lets you down after waiting 15 minutes — this happens often. 
Today I was accused by Uber of not wearing a mask according to a driver that never showed up. No where can I respond. 

In general, Uber In Kenya is impossible to contact. 

I recommend to use Taxify or Little in East Africa. They know their market and are more fair to their drivers.",21-12-2020 16:59

My sister called Uber for me to be nice. On the way home, the friendly Uber driver played great music. He showed a lot of pride with his job.  I didn’t have to tell him how to get to my home because he found it with ease. I would use Uber again and I suggest to others that it’s great service.",24-11-2020 23:22

296,Uber is trash now,1,"The latest update requiring people to take photos of themselves in masks is the reason for bad review. In some places of the US, masks aren’t worn, enforced, or required. Yet, Uber does not take this in to account and requires any riders to show proof of wearing a mask, via photo verify, prior to booking a ride. Account closed and app deleted.",11-01-2021 12:25

298,Great and nice drivers.,5,I have gotten great and really nice drivers able to pick me up to get me to and from work on time. But now I’m being told that all drivers are busy please wait a minute which means for me I have to exit out of the Uber app and go back in order to request a ride which should take less than 60 seconds to find a driver to get me to work without pissing me off,01-01-2021 12:10
299,False Transportation,1,"I have been late to work several different times because it says that they’re no rides available, but when I finally find one the driver says how they’re been trying to find rides all day!!! I’m not understanding??? Is there anyway you could fix that because I would hate for people to lose jobs because lack of transportation",07-01-2021 12:10
300,Reserved time,3,"I do not drive. I rely on public transportation and Uber. You have a feature that can allow me to reserve a time slot in advance. I am reserving this time slot so i can catch a train and get to work. You have drivers that call me to ask where I’m going and bc it’s only 5 min away driving (30 min walking) they cancel the trip 5-10 min before they’re coming. Then I’m left scrambling and I’m late for work. If you can not ensure the driver accepting those “reserved“ times will be accountable and reliable then get rid of the feature. This is the second time it’s happened. The first was a reservation to catch a flight for a vacation. It’s stressful and unacceptable because you ruin important moments for the customer and cause stress.  Again, get rid of the feature if the drivers can cancel with 5-10 min before arrival.",24-12-2020 11:09
301,Was charged over $60 and a refund was refused.,1,I have used Uber since it’s inception and never will again after the experience I had with customer service. I can’t get a single person to talk to me. Only automated responses saying they will give me a $3 credit. I was overcharged by $60. Disgusted.,19-01-2021 20:52
302,Poor customer service,1,"I’m having an issue with a trip and I would like to call or chat with customer service. There is no way for me to do this, and I cannot resolve my issue using their “help” section. I’m extremely frustrated with this app.",08-12-2020 23:50
303,Charged inappropriately,1,"I tried to call an Uber last night, when I was finally connected to a driver the driver contacted me and told me to cancel the trip because it was too far out of his way. I said that if he needed to cancel that was fine but that I was uncomfortable doing so because it would charge me. He assured me I wouldn’t get a cancellation fee, but of course I did get the fee. The Uber app does not have any way in which to submit a reimbursement via the app or website for this situation so instead I’ve resorted to the app review.",16-01-2021 15:14
304,Nope.,1,"Absolutely not & never again. This app won’t accept my card, and one day my Venmo will work and the next it won’t. Unreliable. You guys need to get things right. I am really dissatisfied and I will not use this trash company again. 

Update: Oh what do ya know, Lyft works. And it’s reliable. And my rides pick me up much quicker. EVERYONE- leave Uber in the past this crap is being ran by some degenerates.",17-12-2020 20:43
305,Ripped off,1,"I purchased two online gift cards that never arrived. There charge cleared on my credit card but never received the gift cards. Customer service has been giving me unrelated responses and they keep asking me to explain my problem over and over and over, but will not refund the charges or send the gift cards. Very poor customer service. I feel like they stole my money.",22-11-2020 05:18

307,Can’t get any support!!!!,2,"I’ve been having an issue trying to change a payment method of my Family settings but since an update, there isn’t access to this.  I’ve been trying for HOURS to find ANYONE to speak to so I can make sure my family members don’t get left stranded because of a payment issue on their rides!

Outside of that, I use Uber quite frequently and don’t have many complaints, but the 2 stars are for the lack of support available outside of the HELP tab in the app when there’s an ISSUE WITH THE APP!!!!",20-12-2020 18:49
308,Worst services on the market.,1,"Plain and simple, never get an Uber when a Lyft is possible. Uber is worse in every way from top to bottom and their services are as far from customer friendly as humanly possible. Worthless company.",12-12-2020 08:51

310,Over charged multiple times,2,"I was charged twice for a trip, and it overcharged my bank Acct, it gave me the option to switch payments types, so it took the money from the new payment & still hasn’t refund my overdrawn Acct.

312,Fake Promos,1,I’m deployed overseas for most of the year and I take a lot of rides to get promotions. The promotions aren’t valid out of the U.S but it doesn’t tell you that until after you pay/ride. I have spent thousands of dollars riding with Uber and they won’t even honor a 10% off ride or free delivery on food. It will simply expire and waste your time and money.,20-11-2020 16:11
313,About pass,2,I am being charged for an Uber pass that I didn’t even sign up for. I’ve tried multiple time to contact this company and I’ve had no solution to my problem. This is ridiculous! It should not be that hard to cancel a subscription or to get in touch with someone who would be able to solve the problem. Highly unsatisfied with this app.,11-01-2021 07:47
314,too expensive,2,I’ve used Uber since the dawn of time . It was a great app. But now it got way too expensive. I have this issue with Lyft too.

Today a driver left me waiting and when he arrived, he went straight to my house and canceled right away. There is a curfew and around 7pm it becomes more difficult to get a car. If you didn't want to take me, then don't let me waste time and run the risk of not being able to go to work... Can you imagine me having to call colleagues saying I would be absent? The team's frustration of having to work harder for lack of someone. Our lives are already so difficult. This type of person still appears without any empathy. I hope he and his family are well and healthy.",17-01-2021 22:38
318,Trobles with making several reservations ahead,2,"I’ve been using this application for a long time. Though the problem appeared in the end of December.

322,DON'T GET UBER PASS,1,It’s been two months since I got Uber Pass and I was trying to cancel it but their ‘Help’ section is useless and the ‘Uber Pass’ has a bug that doesn’t allow you to access it. Therefore you cannot cancel your Uber Pass subscription. It’s been absolutely impossible to reach out to Uber and I am extremely disappointed. I’m never going to use Uber again. Instead I will use Lyft. If I could review this app as 0 stars I would.,20-12-2020 18:55
323,Customer service,3,Please add a customer service email because I have had an issue with a driver and need a refund.,19-12-2020 04:48

Keeps taking 1-2 subsequent attempts to get an Apple Pay charge to work. Since the problem only happens here I’m assuming it’s the Über app and not the Apple Card.

I’m logged in.",05-01-2021 03:23
325,Your ride is now a higher price mess,1,My ride yesterday ended up going from 54 dollars to 73 dollars because of this terrible feature. I can’t tell if it’s a glitch or greed but it makes the prices ridiculously higher and it causes a delay in getting a ride by way too long!! I was at the airport for an extra HOUR and 30 minutes waiting to get an overpriced ride only for them to charge me significantly more anyways and I would like an explanation for the issue. EVERY TIME I try to use the Uber app now it keeps telling me my ride is at a higher price and it’s ridiculous I almost can’t use the app anymore. And the app is perfectly up to date for me thanks. Still messing up,04-01-2021 21:50
326,Rateros,1,They are thieves they only want to give the trips at the time they want and if you do them at the mere hour they raise the price 200,13-12-2020 12:46
327,No customer support,1,When you have a dispute and invalid charges you have no way to contact an actual person for support. This frustration has now outweighed any valuable service they have provided me over the years. Don’t use them you will eventually get left in the cold as they care nothing about their customers.,06-01-2021 04:14

329,"Nice Drivers, unfair app pricing",2,"I needed to use Uber.  This was my first time. I downloaded the app, and signed up.  I tried entering a debit card, but it wouldn’t take it.  I tried entering PayPal.  At first it wouldn’t work, but finally did.  I went to schedule a time to be picked up, and it said the rate for an UberX would be $16-$19.  I booked a ride.  A little while later while waiting for the driver, I get a message saying due to demand, pricing will be 3.9x higher.  I was charged $55.02.  It said regular rate wold have been a bit above $13.  On my ride back, it would have regularly been about $12.   My card was authorized for $36 and will be a bit above $33 once the payment is off pending status.  I asked the driver if he was busy (as the Uber app claimed).  He said he wasn’t busy picking up people.  He was delivering for Uber Eats and Door Dash.  Royally stressful, but I don’t own a vehicle so had to eat it in order to get to an appointment in the next city.",18-12-2020 23:45
330,Very disappointed,1,"Omg not only are some of the driver car not clean but now Uber has disabled my account for absolutely no reason at all. This is Insane and I still have Uber credit that I had already bought ahead of time and now my money is gone they are thieves and they disconnect your accounts for nothing and then they never return emails you can’t, you have to email them and I have to email them they do not call you back at all ridiculous. And have you noticed that they still haven’t put up details about there privacy details that is a huge red flag every time I sign up Uber I start getting spam calls back to back then when I uninstall the app they stop calling. I think I may build a app that shows what companies are selling ppl info to Scam callers or scam companies or to other companies in general because it’s very illegal so I guess you would call it a Sue app",06-01-2021 13:38
331,Useless app that is inaccurate,1,Save your time and money for Lyft- better service and drivers. Uber relies on sketchy practices,07-12-2020 18:06
332,What a joke,1,"If you want a ride, I suggest Lyft or your neighbor over Uber. Uber is the most unreliable app in the country. I can never get a ride. They claim to have drivers anywhere but I live in atlanta and can never get a ride. The worst app there is. You’re better off walking to the airport.",05-12-2020 05:02

334,Terrible Customer Service,1,I was unable to add payment method to my Uber account after I downloaded this app and when I try to reach out to their customer support team they told me my payment method has been suspended for an activity violating their terms on the app I found it strange as I have not even had any activities on my account yet...,18-01-2021 16:45
335,Still can’t add additional gift cards,1,"It has been well over a year since my initial complaint. I have about $2 in gift card balance on my account. I bought another gift card to load onto the account, but I don’t have the option to add it, just to view the balance. There have been countless app updates since then with no fix. I’ve ask many times for help with this issue, and all I get is the same instructions over and over, which DO NOT WORK. I have sent screenshots, I have exchanged emails, and more than a year later, this STILL is not fixed??? What a terrible company and a terrible app. I’d rate 0 if I could.",10-01-2021 18:20

337,One bad egg egg ,4,"I cannot let one driver trying to sue someone who has a fixed income because he drives a high priced import for giving passengers rides. Your other drivers at least a 4.8 out of five, the driver trying to sue me in court it is bad form trying to drain someone of a check because of an honest error. He was trying to get in touch with Judge Mathes to get me [I'm from Illinois and thick Inland North accent where has slight Greater Sudbury influence when I turned 24.]",07-01-2021 00:12
338,HORRIBLE “customer service”,1,I have had an issue where I couldn’t tip my driver and there is 0 way to contact uber. This is so ridiculous. I just took an hour and a half ride and promised the driver a good tip  due to it being a day from Christmas and uber keeps telling me my “payment is not valid” which I already fixed. I have tried to call uber which there is no option to do unless you’re a driver or have an emergency.Then I tried emailing them and I get an email back saying it is not a monitored email and  It directs me to their “help section” on the app which is just awful. It’s just a bunch of articles that have nothing to do with my problem. How am I supposed to solve my specific problem if I can’t even speak with anyone?. I would say uber has the worst customer service but I can’t even say that since you don’t even have customer service. Uber you are AWFUL and obviously do not care about your customers or drivers at all.,24-12-2020 22:41
339,Dirty & Wrong,1,"Most drivers drive like idiots. You’ll be left at an instant & they are mostly unprofessional. If your a driver the passengers can make accusations of any sort & you will be placed on hold for up to 48 hrs. Uber doesn’t require proof you did something wrong, just an accusation. They will punish you first, investigate if it’s true, them reactive or permanently suspended you.  Finally, if the accuser made a false allegation, they might suspend them. But you will definitely be punished for being accused.",02-01-2021 17:35

343,Customer service is no where in the app.,1,"I am so frustrated with Uber. You guys need to work on customer service. I can't find any help in disputing cancelation fees. No contact, no emails, or phone numbers to find any kind of help. You guys are such a con artist. I book a ride a day ahead at 5:45 am, next day I tried canceling at 5:00 am and no options to cancel so I waited till 5:30 am options popped up, and according to the map driver was on the other side of the town and was 15 minutes away from my destination pick up so I canceled and why am I getting charged a cancellation fee when he wasn't even near my town and I canceled 15 minutes ahead of time, especially when calling 30 minutes earlier was not an option?",20-12-2020 05:43
344,Rob me,1,"Be very careful with the cleaning policy of the App, it turns out that I asked for a trip that cost me $16 dollars, after two days I get an extra charge of $20 dollars for cleaning the car I got into, it turns out that the driver reported that on my trip I dirty his car and sent a photo showing a stain that I am totally unaware of, at no time did they give me the certainty that I did such damage to the unit which is clearly seen with a cloth with water removes the stain and for that little joke they charged me more than the cost of the trip itself, I was robbed in an unpopulated area for that reason my family and I stopped using the App, it's crap.",18-01-2021 01:54
345,"Used to be great, but..",1,"I use to use Uber anywhere I go because it used to be cheaper than Lyft and I used to be subscribed to the get a set price for cheap  to get to one destination to another but the price got inflated  for the subscription and the ride cost. Now anytime I request a ride that’s typically $10 the drivers send a notification saying their price is $21 or $37 or even sometimes $50, which is ridiculous. They shouldn’t allow their drivers to change the pricing like that. I hate having to spend 15 minutes declining those ridiculously high prices to then be told no drivers available. I ended up downloading Lyft who is way cheaper and more reliable. I hate what Uber has become.",12-01-2021 00:01
346,Very disrespectful face with rolling eyes ,2,So yesterday I was waiting for my Uber so when I get into the car he told me I need your ID and I was like ¿what?

Strictly Lyft from now on.",11-12-2020 09:28

364,Calling it customer service is a joke!,1,"The lack of accountability is astounding! I’ve had minor issues before but, this one is too much. Yesterday I placed an order to be picked up at work and have them take a young man who needed a ride home. He was not feeling well and so I did my best to accommodate him with an Uber in the freezing cold. Upon opening up the app it had my location at my work place. I proceeded to press the destination section and enter the address. A small amount of time goes by and a driver is assigned my order. After about a minute or so of watching the driver’s position on screen I notice he is heading away from my current location. I figured maybe he had another client to pick up and drop off before getting to me. That was not the case. I see the app changes from him being on the way to now we are on route to destination. He has picked someone up at a location approximately 2 miles away from me and is bringing them to my intended destination. I call him to ask where he is going because he has yet to pick me up. He says he is almost there! I said but who is in the car you did not pick me up? He mumbles to himself and hangs up the phone. The man had a very strong accent and spoke with limited vocabulary. Meanwhile, I’m supposed to be at work training supervisors and overseeing part our operation. My favorite was Uber’s expert anti-customer service philosophy. In short, because the destination you chose and the destination we dropped the wrong party off at we’re similar we won’t be giving you a refund. I reached out to their “help” section through the app and have received people equivalent to a wall or as I suspect an automated response system. Three people at Uber all repeated the same rhetoric. I explained multiple times you don’t get it!!! Your driver never picked me up. He never confirmed his party as is his job!!! In fact, he orchestrated giving his friend a ride on my dime and Uber team and their App support are supporting this behavior. Now they are threatening to block me as a user because I am not happy about them allowing someone to steal my money while they sit back and allow it. Resolution: take responsibility for your lack of training with your drivers, take customer service and hospitality training, learn to use the GPS function to support people’s statements when they tell you you never picked me up. Best of all their chat support actually had the Gaul to tell me they don’t have a way of contacting me via phone. You are stealing money and I want mine back. I had to miss work on the drop the person off myself!!!",03-12-2020 15:04

The secondary person got the notification and then that driver canceled the pick up and another driver responded but all of a sudden the pick-up point changed from the drop off point to now being the pick-up point and the pick up point became the drop off. I tried calling the new driver, I tried texting the driver and I tried changing the pick up point back to the correct place but it kept telling me it was outside of my zone. Then when I canceled the trip I was charged a fee for the driver’s time, which I don’t mind, but come on why did the pick up and drop off points reverse themselves when the first driver dumped my request for no good reason. I have had nothing but problems half the times I use this app and today was the worst. It is also frustrating to see each time a driver refuses to pick up a ride. Once I went through twenty different drivers before someone finally said yes.",08-01-2021 23:51
376,Stealing my money,1,It charges me the double of what I order I had money on my account and it charges me the double,07-01-2021 04:31
377,No Profiles Settings,4,The most recent version is missing the profile settings. I’m not able to edit or add family members on my family profile. How I can have the profiles settings back?,03-01-2021 21:38
378,Sneaky attempts at raising prices,1,Uber app offering me my $25 ride for $100+ or asking me to wait longer. Never seen this before and it is a horrible sneaky way to try to take money from existing customers - will be switching to Lyft,03-01-2021 21:46
379,Very unhappy,1,It happened to me twice I ordered something ant the driver only brought me one peace of my entire meal it was chicken a rice they only gave me chicken an when I reached out to Uber it took them a week to response so I didn’t eat that night and of my $28 order they would only give me $3 back and refused to give me my full refund I will not use them again customers are not the priority and they could care less and wouldn’t help any further very disappointed,23-11-2020 14:20
380,Profiles dissapear from the app,1,I haven’t been able to remove my account from a family profile in order to join another profile.This option should be fixed for all the riders. In my case I work for different families and they all pay for my rides.,14-01-2021 16:10
381,Don’t use this app,1,Over charging horrible service and they have a habit of charging you twice for one ride,25-12-2020 19:05
382,No details of the driver,1,"I was waiting for my driver. He did not move from his destination for a long time then canceled on me, he also put a charge on me. There is no such thing is customer support on Uber. No contact number no email address. They only have a few questions which are not valid. When I wanted to report this problem? It did not even provide me the information on this driver that I could report the problem they literally showed no detail of him! So I can’t even click on anything to take action. These guys really don’t care.",10-12-2020 09:45
383,Worse customer service,1,"Last time I ever use Uber. Everyday it gets worse and worse and there is absolutely no way to get in contact with customer support. The help on the app does not have answer for everything. Garbage company, I wish it would go bankrupt",09-01-2021 04:30
384,Horrible customer support,1,"Pray you never have to to actually phone or email customer support! Uber wants you to use their in app support, which is fine until you experience an issue not listed in their self service menu. There is no easily found email address to submit a question (I gave up on trying to find one) and there definitely isn’t a phone number. 

I finally found a number to Uber Eats online but it wasn’t for customer support (the PIN number on my gift card was damaged when I removed the silver coating). The number they provided for customer support (800-253-9377) stated they were not talking calls and no phone support hours were provided. 

So now I have a $50 plastic coaster. Thanks Uber, you’re winning!! Not!!",09-01-2021 16:11
385,Uber rate,5,Great app when you don’t have a car,21-12-2020 00:25
386,Disappointing and Expensive,1,"Multiple times while using this app I have been showed a rough estimate of the cost of my trip, only for the actually cost (after I’ve ridden) to be completely exuberant and unlike the cost I was initially showed. The app gives me no explanation, and I never do anything to warrant the extra charge. I once was taking a trip to the town over and the estimated cost said it would be $30-40. As a broke college student, this amount pained me but I still took it. After arriving to my destination, a full $120 was charged to my account. After an hour of trying to find anything I could do to negate this as I knew that was my grocery money for the month, I was able to request a refund somewhere in the app. They gave me a dollar back. Thanks, Uber. Maybe try Lyft instead.",28-11-2020 22:18
387,Uber is a joke,1,"Driver refused to come and when I canceled and ordered another Uber u kept assigning the same person to me which is madness on ur side of u ask me I had to use a different app to get a ride shame on you Uber (FYI) this happened in Nairobi when I was on vacation there 
Most but not all Drivers  won’t even drive towards u unless u call and tell them where ur going the they refuse and ask u to cancel",26-12-2020 17:16
388,Bad notifications,1,I can't turn off the notifications for Uber Eats promotions which come in at least once a week. Give me the option to opt out!,16-12-2020 20:06
389,Absolutely disappointed with the app,1,Never had an issue until recently when my cards got erased from my account and tried adding them back on and it still won’t let me. Contacted support multiple times and all I got was they’re working on it.,01-01-2021 02:59
390,Worst support on the market,1,"Talking to Uber support feels like yelling into the void. A driver will scam you with the pickup scam, Uber will still charge you a ton for it, say it’s for “a hold fee” then take out $10 for the driver out of the $40. After that you need to find Ubers support which is a chat system not a call one. They send the same responses every time they don’t read the issue at all. 

TL;DR 
USE DOOR DASH",25-12-2020 22:02
391,cancel the races,1,Terrible! Drivers cancel races too much,07-01-2021 11:05
392,Horrible,1,I don’t think an app should be able to help themselves to your card whenever they please. I had to delete my stuff and the app so I wouldn’t keep getting random Uber charges! Horrible!,27-12-2020 21:05
393,Buggy GPS forever,1,"What a waste app, always picks up wrong drop off and pick up location since last 4 years. All of a sudden starts rerouting in the middle of ride for no reason. This is the worst app on this whole planet. Least reliable and efficient, I would say not at all reliable. Seems like developers are least bothered in designing an efficient Uber app or fixing this problem which has been permanent by now. I would have rated negative had there been an option!",03-12-2020 00:02
394,Lyft is better,1,Lyft is way better,20-11-2020 21:34
395,Stop charging me!!!,1,Please do not charge me until you have confirmed a ride that will be able to pick me up. It is an inconvenience for me to have the company take my money without knowing if there will be a driver available for me or not. Y’all owe me so much money for rides I never got.,02-01-2021 23:05
396,There is a bug with payment method,1,"I’m always using credit card to pay for my rides, recently I had some fund credited to my account as Uber Cash, after using that cash the app kept asking me to refill the Uber Cash with no option to pay with credit card. 
I had to delete my credit card info and insert it again to go around that bug, please address in the next update.",29-11-2020 12:12
397,I Voted No on 22,1,You have no customer service. Tried to use a voucher for a ride and the app won’t accept it. Can’t call anyone for help because you don’t care about helping anyone. Just as long as you make money off the backs of people you don’t support.,11-12-2020 23:35
398,Costumer service is weak,3,"Waiting for a response takes forever. Been charged $65.00, money I didn't had. The Uber driver refused to let me clean up my own mess so he can charge me so much. Was a minor spill that could have easily been wiped. Even came back to the car to offer the guy to clean it myself but he refused to let me clean it. I don't understand why the Uber Driver did that. We had a great conversation, he was very polite and professional and didn't got angry about it at all. It was a leather seat too with a minor spill. I could have wiped it myself without issue. 

Fees are way too much and way too risky to ride with Uber. Carrying food often and even can track mud inside a car will let them rob you of their money. They can still charge you for that, as I read online. 

I wish the service was better because it wasn't like I was intentionally trying to ruin this guy car. I can't even pay him.",31-12-2020 18:32
399,Give me back my money,1,"Washington DC, waiting outside a closed restaurant, freezing rain, app shows driver is 6 minutes away, 6 minutes goes by and driver hasn’t moved. Tried to call the driver, no answer, Uber charges me a cancellation fee.  Takes me 30 minutes to figure out how to complain.  Uber keeps my money as a credit for future trips.  Uber has horrible customer service and holding my money hostage.  Looks like it’s back to Taxis for good.",17-12-2020 03:20
400,Charged with out authorization,1,Charged me 24.99 for an Uber pass that I never bought and I can’t get a hold of anyone to get the charges refunded. I have now been charged a second time for this Uber pass that I never ordered or signed up for and of course they make it pretty much impossible to actually get ahold of anyone. Do not trust this company or app. I will never use them again. I have deleted all forms of payment from my app in attempts to stop this since there doesn’t seem to be any way for me to get my money back or actually get in contact with this company.,16-12-2020 12:25
401,Don't use Uber.,1,Scheduled a ride last night for work this morning just to get bailed on 5 minutes before being scheduled to pick up. Thanks for nothing.,02-01-2021 12:03
402,Horrible..,1,This app is absolutely awful. It locked my credit card when I needed a ride the most. I had to stand out in the cold for hours waiting for my friend to end up giving me a ride. I even tried getting a gift card and then every driver would cancel on me. I thought I’d try and use the $70 balance to get some food from Uber eats and it freezes every single time I get to checkout. This app is horrible and it’s customer service is even worse. I wouldn’t even want to rate this 1 star. Disappointed.,17-12-2020 21:50
403,Use lyft this is overpriced,1,Overpriced lyft is way more money,20-01-2021 11:58
404,Nope.,1,"Just now I had a ride and wasn't able to cancel it without a fee when she was 20 minutes away and still completing a ride. Then they decided to cancel it for a new driver that's also 20 minutes away completing a stop wasting the time I waited for the last drive. I called my ride 40 minutes before I have be at work and I'm still pretty late. I don't need to waste my time with a app like this and you don't want to either use Lyft. Never had issues with them. This is my second (recent) issue with Uber.

Update: This dude is fooling around he was just 9 minutes away and now drove away to 14 minutes. Screw this app. Lyft forever.

Update 2: I already called a lyft to work and arrived to work 20 minutes late the guy who fooled around ride got finally canceled so I won't cancel for it to charge me. Lucky my co worker was cool enough to let me off the hook because he knows I'm not a late person. But don't ever waste your time on this app.",23-12-2020 05:20
405,Not downloading poor customer service,1,"Received voucher.  Added to my account.  Suddenly no rides available in my area!  Deleted app, then tried to download again but now saying there is a billing issue and can’t download the app!  No customer service to help either!  Very frustrating and disappointing!",21-11-2020 18:17
406,Uber rating,1,Worst business ever.,14-12-2020 15:00
407,Ridiculously Overpriced,1,Stop jacking up your prices for no reason. It’s not my problem that you’re failing to meet your quota for income. There are plenty of other rideshare apps people can use so stop acting like you’re the only one and show some respect to your customers,22-12-2020 01:27
408,Run Around,1,They don’t even have any type of customer service in any way shape or form. Just a menu that has your questions unanswered and avoided!! shut uber down,21-12-2020 20:29
409,Ride Accepting,3,"Can uber fix when if driver accepted a request they can’t cancel it, really annoying wasting almost a hour trying to find someone else cause I thought I had a ride coming.",17-12-2020 03:59
410,LOYAL CUSTOMERS,3,Why do Uber only offer codes and money off for new customers only? What about your customers that’s been with y’all for years? Think about it,14-01-2021 19:07
411,Map update is dumb.  Can’t see full image anymore.,1,Map update is dumb.  Can’t see full image anymore.  Click to zoom back in and it zooms in too far.  Dumb.,20-11-2020 13:02
412,This review is in regards to the “Eats” portion of the Uber app,2,"It’s cool that the Uber rides app doubles as an Uber Eats app, but unfortunately the Eats portion barely works.  There is NO way to communicate with your delivery driver through the Eats part of the app, and I never receive any communication from the driver either.  The “eats” portion of the app only has about a 60% success rate.  4 separate times I have just not received my order at all, and my order says complete, and I can’t get ahold of the delivery person and they never call me.  (I live in a downtown apartment and I don’t have these issues with Postmates or doordash.)  I’m sure Uber is tired of refunding me for orders I never receive so maybe you guys should just add a call button so drivers can contact me when they can’t find my apartment.",08-01-2021 16:48
413,ride today,5,"driver was dead on with arrival time.  I had forgotten my mask so he allowed me to select one from his supply.   Was a very
safe driver.  Was interested in the election and the virus.
Very pleasant to talk to",17-12-2020 21:11

415,JOHN SULLIVAN: ABOMINATION AND DISGUSTED YOU SUPPORT,1,"Your advertisement including John Sullivan is an abomination and your company should be ashamed to have ever had anything to do with this BLM activist that seeks to destroy property, vandalized property, and incite violence. I will not be agreeing to the terms and want no part of involving Uber ir any entity associated with these violence agitator groups.",16-01-2021 03:42
416,auto upgrade scam,1,"What a scam. You sign up and they automatically upgrade you to Pass which cost $24.99. They auto charge you one month later.  You are automatically signed up for auto renew every month.  
I disputed this and they won’t refund. Only credit to my account on the app. Not acceptable. What a scam. 
I only used it when my car broke. Will never use again. 
Also, can’t turn off autopay and they don’t help when contacting customer service.",14-12-2020 05:14
417,Will not stop blasting me with daily ads for their other services,1,Don’t install this unless you want to be punished with daily notifications about their other services.,22-12-2020 21:07
418,Uber services,1,Ride never came....and it was raining; I was trying to get a ride home.,14-12-2020 04:49
419,Terrible,1,"Do away with driver completing a ride nearby or atleast have a cap on the wait time. I just waited 30 min for a ride from a driver, who nearly missed two exits & swerved over at the last minute on my ride home. Very very disappointed as I am a faithful rider, & supporter of Uber & it’s drivers. The app also needs some work as I would’ve canceled the ride due to the wait time but the app immediately said I would be charged a fee for cancellation. This wasn’t even a full minute after I requested the ride. It is very cold right now & after work I have to get home to care for pets & children so I would appreciate it if my requested Uber can have reasonable wait times or reasonable time frame to cancel.",31-12-2020 07:14
420,Scheduled Rides,1,Scheduled rides are very unreliable.,10-01-2021 17:04
421,Lack of communication,1,I’m fairly new to Uber but so far I’m disappointed with its service. My last 3 visits were canceled with very little notice and I’ve been late to work multiple times now. I’m definitely thinking about finding another company,21-12-2020 21:25
422,Uber stinks,1,"Man, trying to schedule a ride for my out of state disabled mother to the airport and Uber just cancelled her scheduled ride as she was waiting on the curb in 30 degree temps. They also charged me unexpectedly for the driver waiting for 5 minutes the ride before, but I didn't know that there was an additional charge until after I had tipped the driver $10 for his patience. They should notify you of the excess charge. I’m a Lyft person now, Uber stinks.",29-11-2020 16:04
423,bKash Payment and Ride,1,There is no direct option in app to raise any complain against drivers. Uber doesn’t take any action against drivers for their mistakes. Worst service in Bangladesh. Drivers ask first where I want to go after that they decide to move. If any drive misbehaved with a client then there is no option to complain against him,27-12-2020 02:00
424,Use to be able to order food,2,Why did you take away the order food feature don’t everyone have space on there phone to have two apps. Like if I try to order food on here it just takes me to download Uber eats like why can’t you just keep it simple? I don’t have space on my phone for two apps this is ridiculous that it’s the same thing but can’t keep it on one app like how they use to. I would use both features in one app now I have to have to apps for both features. It was more convenient and made Uber different and better from other apps when they had it like that.,25-11-2020 20:23
425,Never again,1,"Waited 45 minutes for a driver to pick me as a ride from SFO. I selected any car I could and said yea to every upgrade that came just so I could get a car. It took 45 minutes before I got a ride. He said “oh that’s crazy there’s hundreds of cars sitting in the lot waiting.” 

I will use Lyft to return to the airport tomorrow.",16-01-2021 07:48
426,Least Reliable Ride Service,1,The location tracking is by far the worst and to add on top of that if it messes up and you cancel your getting charged. Super frustrating when you need it the most!!!,04-12-2020 15:54
427,uber cash does not work !,1,"i put $60 on a uber card i added the gift card to my account i go to request a ride and it says payment invalid and to add another card i try to add another card it says payment invalid and tells me to enter ANOTHER card i try 3 times i ran out of cards , i can’t transfer the uber cash to another account so therefor i wasted $60 on this bullsh*t app i want my money back i will never be using uber again",22-11-2020 16:34
428,Quantity over quality clearly,1,"I think they’re hiring anyone since the pandemic, but I have never felt as uncomfortable in ubers than i do now. I’ve had too many separate occasions where im only getting male drivers that have made inappropriate sexual references , and drivers that literally speed past your exit! Using lyft from now on , at least they actually do background checks and interviews! Uber is the ghetto! Completely unsafe!",19-11-2020 18:13
429,they stole 100 dollars from me,1,100 dollars in my application and they gave me an unknown amount and now they do not want to return it,16-12-2020 21:16
430,Never any available drivers,1,"If you live in a major city then this is useful. But apparently there are no drivers in west pennsylvania, and uber has the gaul to send me a msg “planning on traveling soon? Schedule a trip” just a useless app",18-01-2021 12:02
431,New App Glitch,1,Lately when I have a lending ride and I open the app it takes me to the home page as though I need a new ride. It oft takes a while for the app to reload and give me information about my ride. Very frustrating!,02-12-2020 22:50
432,App works. Customer service is horrible,1,"I was charged for a Uber eats subscription I never signed up for. I’ve been in contact with support for almost a week. I kid you not... total run around. It’s like they’ll do anything to not refund my money. Now I’m at the point where I’m done with all the services. I just want my refund and payment methods cleared out of the system since no one is really trying to help me resolve my issue. 

Phone support doesn’t seem to help either. I’ve been told that the chat feature will be helpful in resolving my issue but that hasn’t been true.

Since my PayPal account was charged without notice nor a receipt it gives way to let me believe that it was a fraudulent charge from the company. I’ve stated multiple times in my “support ticket” that there has to be an internal audit system to track what API calls my user makes (that would cause charged to appear). No one wants to check that. I’ve given all the payment information I can. And I’m still being asked the same questions. I don’t have a case number so I can’t paste it here, but to me this shows a true lack of transparency on how/why a charge was made and a receipt hasn’t been sent.

I want to close my account, but I do fear more fraudulent charges will come through since I can’t get an explanation on the first one, nor a reversal, nor any follow up to my comments in my “support ticket”.

Overall when things work the service is great. Hopefully no one has to run into customer service though. It feels like the customer needs to get paid for dealing with that",21-12-2020 13:17
433,Rampant fraud is allowed by Uber,1,"Rampant fraud is allowed by Uber, they’ll allow it to occur so long as it doesn’t affect their bottom line. Repeatedly tried to reach out to Uber to resolve the issue and they ignored it.",14-12-2020 17:05
434,"Family Profiles are really buggy, and support is delivered via murderbot",2,"The family and business profiles don't work well, and the ability to manage them just disappeared from both the app and the web. Support is apparently provided by a bot, not a human, making it both slow and incoherent- it just reacts to the latest keywords in your message and applies no context.

Glad they are getting out of the self-driving car business, I can only speculate how many more people their terrible programming skills would have killed off.",22-12-2020 18:22
435,Uber Lied About Prop 22,1,"Before Prop 22 passed, I received continuous messages about the benefits that we as passengers would receive if it passed like lower ride costs. Now, I’m paying TRIPLE for my rides. This is a scandal and it’s even more inconvenient that most of the drivers have zero professionalism by not following CDC guidelines to stop the spread of COVID 19, to taking ridiculously longer routes to destinations that end up costing more. I’d avoid using this service if you want to save money and not get COVID!",22-12-2020 20:59

439,Stole money from My bank account,2,I literally requested a ride for only $9 on 01/18/2020 ...2days later I get a message from my bank stating I got this ride for $13 I’m not using Uber ever again and I’m disconnecting my card I only went down the street!!!????!?face with rolling eyes person shrugging ,20-01-2021 13:17
440,Unreliable,1,It takes more than half an hour to find any sort or ride and it’s caused me to be late to important meetings and work even if I order it wayy earlier than usual it takes multiple tries to even get any ride and it’s a big inconvenience.,08-01-2021 19:41
441,Uber service,2,Is frustrating to know how good they have been and how bad it gets now.  The app is constantly glitching.,03-01-2021 19:09
442,Customer Service,1,When dealing with anything customer service related you will not get any support. Period.,10-12-2020 22:59
443,About Eats,1,Really disappointed with the food option in this app. I had 2 different promotions that clearly said they could be used up to 14 days after receipt. I created my order and when I went to check out it said both promotions had expired. I’ll be using other food apps that honor their promotions instead.,28-11-2020 23:31
444,GO TO LYFT,1,Terrible whenever you cancel a ride it and try to request again it gives you the same driver it works on it’s on time it doesn’t care if you are in a rush for work or anything it’s a terrible app go to Lyft I did,20-11-2020 19:54
445,Above,1,Y’all have to get more reliable with y’all workers they’re not coming on time are being responsible with my time so can y’all please fix this and stop charging me for canceling fees if the Uber is dropping off another person he/she is not on the way they are dropping off another person. So please fix this,11-01-2021 00:31
446,fake promos,1,"I drove for Uber for 4 years. I haven’t drove In 14 months. I got a new phone and a new number. I signed up to get delivery. They immediately sent me an email that I could get $30 off my first order. I figured I might get free delivery or a few bucks off. I wasn’t expecting $30 off!!! However, whe applying the code it said my ‘device not supported’. I have an iPhone 11 Pro Max. I tried using my iPad. Same thing. My boyfriends phone didn’t work either. Tried my old android. Didn’t work. Even tried a regular laptop. Nope!!! I tried every device available! 

I can’t contact them on the phone. Uber, I was loyal to you for years as a DRIVER. Why are you scamming people??",20-12-2020 02:52

449,Wouldn’t recommend.,1,"I live in a very small town. Anywhere in town is tops a 10-15 minute ride, no more than 10 miles any direction. On a daily basis I have to use Uber and on a daily basis I pay anywhere from 35-70 dollars for a ride. That is how much it took me to fill up my gas tank. Even when the suggested price is 12 dollars, the drivers will not pick you up for less than 30. Not a good app if you are trying to save money, you’d be better off walking.",21-12-2020 01:47
450,Cancellation Policy,2,"Multiple times I’ve called an Uber and the wait time for one was unreasonably long because the driver was 5-10 minutes away from dropping off their current passengers. Under the current cancellation policy I will be charged to cancel the uber because it is “already on the way”, but it is still dropping off a totally separate group at a totally separate location. I understand why there are cancellation fees, but there should not be a cancellation fee when the driver is with another rider.",12-12-2020 01:08
451,App is messed Up,1,My app has been misbehaving and I have reinstalled several times already and even contacted the support several times but yet they can’t help me fix it. I am forced to open another Uber account and lose my gold membership as my rewards is now frozen in my original account. Not happy. I use Uber not less than 4 times a week and I am sad I can’t get any rewards.,05-12-2020 02:35
452,Scheduling a ride for a future date and time,2,I have to admit that you have done a piss poor job of programming to schedule a ride on for a future date and time.   It’s rather cryptic to non existent.  How could you be this careless.  The competition does a much better job than Uber does.  When I need to schedule a ride I’m forced to use LYFT based on your inability to create a reasonable option to schedule a future ride.,27-12-2020 03:30
453,Charged for walking,1,Charged me and didn’t even confirm a ride i want my money back,30-11-2020 11:15
454,Funding account,3,I’ve been using Uber for a while now and I am still having trouble loading money to my account using my card that’s hooked up to the account. Why I don’t know. But it is very irritating on the task I have to go through to find it in other ways. Please fix that!,08-01-2021 15:27
455,Not delivering on the promise,1,"7:35 am Scheduled a ride to for work to be on time. For 8:15 am. App informs me “Your estimate $22-$27” Sounds good.
8:13 app start telling me there is no cars available, login to confirm your ride at the higher rate $106.... I declined.... $81, I declined again. App starts playing the game of numbers... $96.... $106... $84... I am already outside it’s start raining.
8:15 App informs that there is no driver’s 
Ok... What do I do now?
I try to schedule another ride. App informs me that the funds are not available, change the card. Wow... I open account see Uber pending $27, now I have $13 left on my card. Of course it’s insufficient fund. You took the money, promised me that you will pick me up and drive me to my destination, and screwed me over.
For past 30 minutes trying to see if I can reach Uber support...
-Ride doesn’t exist, so I can’t click on it and app would allow me to tell what went wrong. 
-Can’t message support, no option 
Please do me a favor, don’t tell me you sorry.
Eat your 1 star.",28-12-2020 17:09
456,Can not add multiple stops,3,"I’ve never had to request an Uber for multiple stops before so this might be a recent bug, but who knows. i had to be dropped off at my first destination because my driver said he couldn’t drive me further without the multiple destinations being added. i was left in the snow, for about 30 minutes (thankfully it wasn’t too cold). i don’t believe this was the drivers fault. he couldn’t have been more apologetic. later that evening i had the same issue with multiple destinations not being able to be added. might try Lyft instead to see if this is an option without issue",18-12-2020 03:20
457,Great app,5,Everyone thinking of downloading this app I highly recommend it. Every time I ever get an Uber I’m greeted and dropped off safely,24-12-2020 16:49
458,Never again.,1,"The absolute worst service as well as customer service. I wouldn’t get an enemy an Uber. 

Dont spend your money here, your better off BURNING IT.",23-12-2020 21:57
459,Best Uber,5,This is a good app I have a lot of customers and the people getting orders for is nice this is a good app if your going to get it I think you would love it write me back if you love it,20-12-2020 19:07
460,Terrible app.,1,"Uber has become a lousy service, for a few weeks all the drivers do not take the services at the normal rate, forcing dynamic rates and thus turning the service into an excessively expensive and bad service, I do not know how this can be fixed because the drivers They have become super tricky, then if they accept the trip at the normal rate they cancel it until it is in the dynamic rate, I have had to take trips paying 4 times the normal rate only because the drivers put the rate like that, what a pity of service what was it.",30-12-2020 12:18
461,Words,3,Uber always have a  slow drivers Yu can set a time and they still late that’s why lyft the best,08-12-2020 11:52
462,Best Uber ride ever,5,This the best Uber ride of my life you need to promote hector,21-11-2020 00:13
463,Worst customer support,1,"Uber has literally been the worst customer support experience ever. I requested a ride to work, however even though the funds were taken and processed, my ride was never received, nor was I ever sent a driver. 
I reached out (the only way I could, via submitting a request online and reaching out via Twitter DM). Was told that there was nothing they could do based off their “refund policy”, even after I’ve confirmed that that funds were taken shut my ride was not received. They simply stated that next time “make sure to verify things” next time, and to set up extra security measures. I asked for a credit at least for the funds that were taken; and they stated again, per their refund policy, there’s nothing that can be done. 

Customer service was absolutely no help at all.",12-01-2021 00:02
464,TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,1,I was charged a fee to my card that I didn’t authorize and they did nothing to help me fix this. Their customer service needs to get better. They don’t even deserve 1 star. Worst experience ever. Will not ever download this app or use anything relating to Uber again.,22-11-2020 17:34
465,Quality service,1,No support,22-11-2020 01:54
466,Best ride sharing APP!,5,"I’ve had the great experience/pleasure of using UBER now for 2 years and it never failed to be reliable, consistent and accountable in regards to my ultimate satisfaction.  However, since the pandemic which ultimately triggered in March for the U.S. the pool option on UBER  was no longer available- this was due to the social distancing regulations that were put into place.  With that said the pool was way more efficient for me and many other users, as I surveyed customers trips (mainly because it was way less to travel with someone) rather then call an UBER X and ride alone. 
As a very big customer I feel if we don’t bring this pool back anytime soon customers are going to shift to cheaper , more affordable prices.  UBER will certainly maintain status if it prices stay at a descent price for customers.  Happy customers make great companies. THANKS UBER for your commitment. 

Best regards, Vic DiBenedetto",15-12-2020 19:35
467,No way to dispute cancellation fee,1,"If the driver didn’t come to your address and not picking up the phone, u will be charged a fee for not taking a ride. So basically u can end up without a ride and have to pay for that !",02-12-2020 19:31
468,disappointed,1,It doesn't work just to steal money they have charged me $40 according to why a terrible disaster occurred I never use this application again they think that one collects the money.,03-01-2021 19:53
469,Uber is a savior,5,Never bought a car and Uber had helped me commute every single day ever since I moved to Chicago. I have Uber Pass and I’m happy with the service.,03-01-2021 18:01
470,Always waiting for a higher price.,2,May as well just get lyft. Don’t do it.,20-12-2020 10:24
471,You pay if your driver cancel trip?!?!?!?!?!!?!!??,1,"It’s unbelievable, I ordered Uber , driver cancel trip before arrive to my location and they charging me 5 dollars!!!!!!!!!!
I think it’s a trick that the app do to make more money, I request to get the money back. There were no respond there is no number to call. Rate 0/10",03-12-2020 13:37
472,Charge a wait fee when you need to install a car seat,4,My family used Uber while traveling. The drivers were all very kind and professional. Each time we were ready and waiting for the driver to arrive. I noticed that after the trip there was always an additional $0.50 to $1 charge. When I looked up what the charge was for I found out that Uber charges a per minute wait fee from when the driver arrives to when we leave. I think this is completely unfair for families that need to install car seats or passengers with disabilities that may take longer to get into the vehicle. Very disappointed and we will be getting a rental next time.,19-11-2020 18:44
473,It’s hard to tip the drivers.,2,"On my way there I had to try and try again to tip the first driver, when I pressed on the button nothing would happen. No it was not a reception issue I tested that. Eventually it just started to work. Now after my second ride back home I cannot leave a tip at alI, I press the button again nothing happens. This is very irritating and shows what a poor quality app this is.",02-12-2020 00:50
474,Ridiculous,1,I was running late for work so I need a ride ASAP. I went to Uber trying to get a ride but the closest one was 20 minutes away but the ride was only 16 dollars. When I tried to cancel the trip Uber wanted to charge me 20 dollars!! 20 dollars was more than the trip was worth. I’m very upset about this and I’m deleteing the app,23-11-2020 11:14
475,Poor service don’t care about customers,1,"Glad your Uber drivers can see the length of the trip and cancel the ride at the last minute at no penalty. Glad weren’t deemed hourly workers in Cali, absolute bums, horrible",02-01-2021 05:26
476,Not the best.,2,It’s ten dollars one way for two miles. Not worth it but when I was in Vegas it was decent. It would be better if the developer would allow drivers to see what you put in as additional instructions or nots because they don’t see it until they pick up the order and that’s not good if you live in a confusing place or if you live in government building or a military base where they cannot drive in and you have to walk a long ways to pick up your food which defeats the purpose...,19-12-2020 22:42
477,NOT GOOD IN WINTER,3,I usually use uber all year round and live in Chicago but ever since Covid the prices are Ridiculous. 1. There is no ride share 2. No wait and save. Lyft at least has a wait and save and prices aren’t as ridiculous. Uber really tries to rob you during the winter times... not cool.,04-01-2021 23:11
478,Cheats..,1,"Somehow, I subscribed to the Uber pass, or drive pass, whatever it is, and didn’t realize it.  I didn’t it for 2 months, because I never saw a confirmation of payment, or Uber a verification that I wanted to go further with the payment.  I was charged &24.99 for the month of October, and November.  Yes, I did realize payment had come out, but I recently lost my mother unexpectedly, so I wasn’t focused on the payment at the moment.  Anyway, I don’t even know why Uber would charge me$24.99, because I live in San Antonio TX, and we don’t even have the ride pass here, and the closest city that does is Austin, and their rates are $14.99!! The $24.99 is a California rate!  I received one month, but I want all of my money back Uber!!",25-12-2020 02:13
479,HORRIBLE UNSAFE SERVICE!,1,GOT STRANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF A HIGHWAY AND UBER WILL NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY. VEHICLES THEY APPROVE  ARE NOT IN SAFE DRIVING CONDITIONS AND THEY DONT CARE!,21-12-2020 16:56
480,GPS is off,1,Can’t trust the gps to get my location accurately.  Puis me next door when I’m at home.  It’s not clear how to request a ride.  Not sure I can trust this app.,18-11-2020 17:51
481,Messy Messy,2,"I use to prefer Uber over Lyft. Now neither seem reliable in getting any rides at all. Either they boost their prices way too high just for a 10 minute trip (I'm talking 40$ just to get somewhere that usually cost 15$) as well as whenever I really need an Uber, like an urgent need cause I have no transportation they never have any drivers available. The app say anywhere at anytime, yet they need to change it to anywhere depending on the distance and anytime that isn't late night cause they really blowing minds",02-01-2021 04:53
482,So many GPS issues and picky drivers,3,"I’m not sure if it’s just where I live and I live in Los Angeles a very populated city but these drivers are getting more and more picky and I understand because they’re not getting a fee from smaller rides, but something is something , if I wanna go say at least 5 miles away from my house it takes forever for a ride to come!!!! as well as the GPS is a complete utter mess , they have them going the longest route ever when there’s so many other simpler routes, as well as I noticed when I’m waiting for an Uber there’s so many drivers around but they don’t want to get me either because it’s a short ride or they simply just sit there and waste my time.",16-12-2020 22:26
483,Scamming,2,How can I be guaranteed that my information will not be shared or that Uber will take responsibility for the scam that recently took place on my account? In the past two months I’ve had to call my bank and order two different cards because Uber decided to charge almost 300 dollars for transactions that did not even appear on my Uber account only on my CC statement. I have not heard from Uber and they have not reached out to offer an explanation or any possible security breach acknowledgment.,23-11-2020 22:50
484,NO mandatory face mask,1,I don't like your mandatory face mask.,11-12-2020 17:44
485,Above,5,I lost my account I can't get it back I used it last Tuesday,16-01-2021 02:39
486,Carp carp carp,1,"Still the same. I was forced to use it in Colombia since I did not know about other ride sharing apps that work here. Well, Uber works 1 time out of 10, usually no one accepts orders.",23-12-2020 00:15
487,Sleeping Drivers,1,"It is a 30 minute commute from my household to my worksite. I tend to use uber because I can get there on time. Unfortunately, I've witnessed not 1 - not 2 but atleast 5 different uber drivers half asleep on the wheel and swerving while driving. This is unacceptable. Please UPDATE DRIVER GUIDELINES !!!!!!",16-12-2020 19:10
488,Bad design re: offer code redemption and issue resolution,1,"Was sent a $30 off UBer Eats. I thought about placing an order and applied the code but then cancelled the order to use later within the offer period. When I tried to use it, I got a message saying the code had been used. There is no place in the app to report issues, so I am having to resort to reporting via a negative review.

For getting a ride, this is a decent app, but my experiences so far with Uber eats is less than acceptable and the main reason I am leaving a one star review. I’ll be running with Grub Hub, thanks.",25-11-2020 23:06
489,I’m sick of Uber,1,At first Uber was okay but than things started happening like the drivers having extra people in the car or almost getting into accident more then once with different drivers but recently I’ve been so feed up because their gps take them a long way or something happened on there in and they just take extra money from out my bank like one time a Uber driver got lost so I had to pay for that extra time why idk and just recently as in last night I had to pay for the extra because my ride hade to go a longer way because it was a accident and the police had the regular way blocked off how is that my fault and mind y’all they take the money without asking me so that’s really stealing and I’m sick of it they can’t connect me to head charge so I’m done using Uber,05-12-2020 12:19
